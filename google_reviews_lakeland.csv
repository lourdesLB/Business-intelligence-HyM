8 months ago|Javymar Urdaneta Martinez|I came to H&M Lakeland and it was the worst experience. The fitting rooms close 40 minutes before the clothing store closes. The customer service was terrible. And the teens that work there don‚Äôt have any customer service skills and have a terrible attitude. I came with my mom from out of the country and It was a Horrendous experience.|1
