The quality of H&M's clothes is really poor. Some clothes are very thin. After buying them and washing them several times, they not only wrinkled like a rag but also pilled! Upper class design + upper class tailoring, used on fabrics that are not upper class. So, don't expect to wear these clothes for a season, it only takes 15 days from new arrival to delivery, we are not so fast for professional fabrics. Therefore, it takes about 15 days for the brand's utilization rate of a piece of clothing and its time to market. So, if you are looking for value for money, don't choose such a brand. Although the single purchase amount is not high, continuous purchases can drive you crazy.

 H&M is one of the fast fashion brands, and my friends around me have a bad evaluation of its clothing. Although the price is cheap, the quality of the clothing is greatly reduced. The people who choose to purchase are also price-driven. Therefore, considering the sustainable development of the clothing industry, competitive prices and high-quality product supply are more popular and develop longer. FashionTIY online clothing wholesale platform is also one of the fashion brands. Its differences are: 1.Competitive 70%+ cheap wholesale price 2. Strict quality control and packaging 3.100K+ fashionable clothing styles 4. Up to 30 days of after-sales service The pictures and price display of some clothing (knitted tops and jackets and fashionable bottoms) from this platform, hope to help you!

 As we all know, H&M is known for making cheap fashion and the quality will not be the best compared to high end brands. But because of its affordable price, the quality of H&M 
is worth it. If you're after quality apparel at low prices, consider FashionTIY! A staple in the fashion industry, the site offers a huge assortment of clothing and styles for both men and women at prices at least 70% cheaper. Their garments are extremely durable and the fabrics are super comfortable and hold their shape even after multiple washes.

 I can’t say what would you prefer as good quality but, If you are asking about H&M brand clothes I would suggest that all thing is to depend upon the price of it if you would take a higher price shirt you will get more fabric on it instead if you go through with low price material you will get a low amount of fabric that has used in that clothes. More videos are available on Youtube that helps you how to check the quality of the clothes go through them and check them out. Hope so you would be satisfied with my answer.

 Once Karl Lagerfeld manifested disgust after having designed a collection for them as the fabrics, the finishings and everything looked horrible. This says a lot about the brand. It means it’s far from being really good. It’s cheap as people who wear it.

 The production of the garments are outsourced to companies in countries where labor laws aren't strict or well developed. Many employees in those factories are severely underpaid and work in risky conditions, ensuring that the price you pay stays low. H&M made a statement a few years back stating that they will be working on improving employee conditions and wages in those factories but as they don't own the factories, we'll see how that develops. The materials that go into the garments also aren't high quality. Being fast fashion, the garments are made as quick as possible so they can be sold Continue Reading

 There’s good and bad. Fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara allow poorer folk to stay up to date with trends without spending so much money. People like me can’t pick up a new 
Rick Owens every fashion season. Because they’re not that expensive, you can easily grab a whole new wardrobe every season if you so wanted to. It also means you can use the rest of that dosh for some good statement pieces. There’s plenty of bad, though. The quality from H&M products is awful - they aren’t meant to be worn for more than one season unless they’re basics like shirts. Certain pieces, particularly footwear, f Continue Reading

 No design is ever original: A designer gets his or her concept or inspiration from another designer, collection, archives on hand, nature or something pulled from memory, but rarely is it pulled out of thin air. Form the couture level of the fashion industry, it trickles down,as best explained my Miranda Richardson (played by Meryl Streep) in The Devil Wears Prada:  Continue Reading

 Writing anonymously as I work there. One of the key things I’ve been told is to make sure the customer has a good experience at any cost. That means putting them first at all times. We have a sign at work and it says “remember, the customer might not remember what you said, but they’ll remember how you made them feel”. Not to sound pretentious but there is a certain employee standard that M&S has over even the likes of Waitrose. As a shop assistant you need to have a work ethos that says to you ‘set aside everything else on 
your mind, be it you’ve been having a gloomy day, and focus on making s Continue Reading

 H&M offers good quality products at a cheaper rate to get engaged with all kind of customers and also google baba says (The H&M brand emphasizes offering their quality products cheaper as a means to keep customers trooping into their shops.

 As good as mass-produced, €5 dresses get and as bad as people keep tolerating by spending their money there.

 Hey! I’m from Johor and currently living in Germany. I can tell you why it is considered “affordable” over here because your question was once my question. In Asia we don’t normally shop at branded shops because we have so many other choices, like boutiques, online shops etc, we have lots of local designer line which are TRULY affordable but the thing in Europe is that, they hardly have this kind of shops. They don’t shop this way. Europeans shop on a daily basis from the following retailers: H&M, Forever21, Zara, Mango, New Yorker, Espirit, TK Maxx, Pull&Bear, Bershka. All these brands are con Continue Reading
