 how on earth do you get in touch with an actual store! the "customer service" line is far from customer service with an endless loop and voice that almost puts you to sleep with irrelevant information, despite dealing with frustration when you only want to speak with a human.
i can understand why not providing store phone numbers needs to be kept secret. its not as if we can even order online in australia. way to go h&m!
