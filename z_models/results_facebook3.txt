 i tried to post a review at the karrinyup store but they seem to be blocking reviews. im not surprised given their very poor levels of customer service. at myer and every other big department store you can return an online purchase in-store. not so at h&m, they stare at you and dare to chant the company policy rather than trying to help an elderly person who was returning an item with a fault. they wouldn't even address the question being asked. very poor standards.

 all fitting rooms are closed so you have to purchase what you want and return the items if not needed. i left and went to woolworths where i can try the clothing on before purchasing.

the exchange, he did not even try it on and unfortunately due to circumstances i was not able to exchange the product sooner. the cashier explained nicely that the exchange date was within a month from purchase, i explained to him and his supervisor that i was not able to. the product had all the tags a... ver mas
