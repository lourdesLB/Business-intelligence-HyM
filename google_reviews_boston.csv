3 weeks ago|Regan Wilkins|I loved these pants like loved them. I literally wore them a few times and just purchased them a month ago. But this morning when i already had my jeans on and ready to go I bent down to grab something and they ripped right by the pocket. I tried calling customer service but they said it would be difficult to do an exchange because i didn‚Äôt have any tags(but i have the receipt). So yeah I won‚Äôt be purchasing these or any of these again.|1

3 years ago|Emily Allie|I want to know why you have 2 floors, ample men's clothing, ample women's clothing, a section for accessories, even a housewares section. But 0 plus size options. It's really overdue for mainstream retailers to be inclusive. I don't need to try on a duvet cover, I do need to try on clothes that fit my body. I shouldn't have to explain to a global retailer in 2019 how awful it is to be having a fun shopping day with your friends on Newbury Street and need to sit out when they hit your store just because you're not the same size as your friends.|1

5 years ago|Christina Orne|Yesterday 10/21 around 11am I had a bad encounter with a sales associate/supervisor working the fitting room. I had several garments including a hat, to match an outfit I was considering in purchasing. Associate stated I was not allowed to go into the fitting room with the hat to try on, not knowing I previously worked at H&M and know the fitting room policy. So I asked him how would I be able to try on the hat with the outfit then, he stated I can go in the fitting room put on the garments I want to try on then call him and he will bring the hat, then take the hat back. Which did not make any sense. Later after I purchased the hat he didn‚Äôt allow me to try on, I informed him I previously worked at H&M and know that you are allowed to go into the fitting room to try on hats with out being monitored, I had ask to speak to a supervisor to make a complaint not knowing he was actually the supervisor on shift. Sales associates including supervisors should never profile a customer like that as you can lose sales. Yes I looked young and I am African descent doesn‚Äôt mean I plan to steal a $12.99 hat. Which everyone knows anything over $9.99 has sensors on them. He told me if I still have an issue just call customer service to make a complaint and have a nice day (sarcastically). Employees like that should be addressed and properly trained on discrimination and customer service skills.|1
5 years ago|Royry Walker|You mean to tell me i can go to Braintree with less selection than a flagship location and find just what i need? Horrible service hot and not shopable. Clothes on the floor and customer service is -100. I hear the emplyees complain about how they hate it there and cant wait to leave. Obviously they need more people that loves there job. And can help me find a basic shirt without having to ask 10 different people. Gotta love low budget fashion|1
4 years ago|Kubi D|Horrible Experince! The lady at the fitting room was so awful and mean. I had over seven items and she said that I would have to try on the rest of the items later which I was completely okay with. Later I was underdressed so I politely asked if she could hand me the other items in exchnage for the items I had already tried on, she looked at me and said that I would have to come out and get them myself! I was liteally five steps away from her! Later when I stepped out to get my stuff, she asked how many items I had I said six and she would not believe me so she made me, so she counted all the items herself. I feel offended and never had such an expereince at H&M.|1

6 months ago|pranitha r|This place has a really good collection on a random day and no good collection at all on other days. Considering that this place is always crowded and billing line is always huge, they don‚Äôt have staff on the first floor for billing ok weekdays which makes it look like it is crowded all the time|2
8 months ago|Gregory J|Long wait in line even with 4 registers open. Same as Zara down the street. Be prepared to wait. The mostly Gen Z workers just move extremely slow and unmotivated. Asked for a bag, she forgot to give me one, and then bowed to me Buddhist style and got it passive aggressively. Weirdest interaction I've ever had in a store.|2
8 months ago|Tatiana Simonova|"Extremely rude and unhelpful staff working in the fitting rooms. Also, it's impossible to go there with friends to see wheather things look good on them or not because ""it's not allowed to go into the fitting rooms area"", which is weird coz it's allowed in pretty much every single HnM I've ever been to."|2
5 years ago|Tanya Circosta|Only went in here for a few men's tees. It was so crowded you could hardly move and huge lines for the fitting rooms.  Clothing racks are over-flowing and crowd the entire store, so not much room to move through the store, so good for a quick in-out visit, but wouldn't be very relaxing to actually browse around.  Got the tee's we needed though.|2
8 years ago|Jon Silver|Sure it's big, and has a great range, but the floor service was dismissive and unhelpful, and the checkout service was appallingly slow, and the girl just stuffed the clothes into a bag without even folding them. But to be honest she was much more interested in joining her colleagues in conversation about anything but what was happening in the store. H&M needs a secret shopper to kick the backsides of these lazy staff and protect the brand.|2
7 months ago|Kate Goldberg|Chronically understaffed and extremely hot and humid. I almost passed out waiting in line to check out.|2
5 years ago|Cory Stasko|If you need clothes that are moderately overpriced, this is a fine choice. But generally the culture and values that they project seem to emerge from this sad combination of mindless fashion, body shaming and copratism. And one can only assume that any money you spend there will go towards advancing those unfortunate values.|2
6 years ago|Luli Ramirez|I like this store because they have children cloth, but I had several problems here, like they left the alarm tag on several times and they didn't put all the items in the bag (that happened to me twice, once I paid for a shirt which wasn't in the bag and another time I thought I'd bought  a shirt, which wasn't in the bag when I got home... so many mistakes here!|2

a year ago|Daisy Mendez|Hnm is the main location for work clothes and business casual clothes.  However it seems like they have less and less clothes out. There's usually only 1 maybe 2 registers open so be prepared to wait. That goes for downstairs as well. They have a huge children's section but for women good luck trying to find your size. Still a great store to find clothing but its more like a needle in the haystack.  I wish they never closed the downtown location.  That location made sure to have a wide range of items and don't bother trying Cambridge location they don't have much either.|3

I ask this girl and notice that they do help the guests but have this kind of rude attitude. Even though I love the clothes, not too much luck for me in this occasion. COVID safety: everyone wears a face mask (staff and guests), didn't see any signs of bathroom open or antibacterial available.|3
3 years ago|Sarah Watanabe|They had a decent selection of clothes for both men and women in terms of styles and pieces but they dont have a good size range on the plus size end. The biggest size they have in shirts is 14 which, while fitting in some areas.. didn't fit in other areas (intentionally vague). Store is two story and the staff is friendly but don't always take the initiative to ask if you need help. This is not always a bad thing as sometimes you want to peruse without having to talk to anyone.|3
4 years ago|Lauren Madigan|Clothes are alright quality for the price, some articles are more fairly priced than others, some are just awful quality. Gotta try stuff on! Overall a ton of inventory to choose from. Checkout and dressing room lines tend to be long and move slow, depends on which employees are working and what hour of day you go.|3
5 years ago|Sam Zarakovich (sonic shadow gaming)|The store has a great selection of clothes at a high price though. The colors are not exactly unique in their range of avalibtes. Although their clothing patches are fun and cute. Their range of accesories are low to midrange at best.|3
10 years ago|Meet the birds Life in a small house|The store had a lot of clothing to look at however the racks were really close together making it very had to move around in the store. The fitting room on the top floor had a huge line. The fitting room on the ground level had no one in it.|3

6 years ago|Elijah Grey|I mean, let's just say my entire wardrobe is from H&M. I go shopping here seasonally dressed like I own the place, and I have customers approach me for help thinking I work there. Fortunately, I'm knowledgeable on styles and colors currently on trend at the different locations. Excellent staff. Professional service and simply great sty!  [Excellent men collection.]|5
5 months ago|Cheryl Jackimocz|Downtown Boston. Very nice store. Clothing for the younger generation.|5
5 years ago|Timothy Killilea|This is a great place to get needed clothing for cheap. In October, I needed to get a pair of black shorts for work. It was hot outside and the Fall clothing was in season.  However, they still had some inventory for the Summer left, and it was convenient that I didn't have to sweat my tomatoes off wearing black pants on a hot and humid day.  While there, it was nice to see that they give discounts for returning used clothing back to them in an effort to recycle. The impact that this has on our environment and the effort that H & M takes to give this opportunity makes me more cognizant of buying their stuff.  I will say, it tends to look fashionable, not Derelict-y enough but there is always a slight consideration to buy their stuff. The recycling they offer and the discount because of bringing in their used clothing is important in my consideration.  Always clean and friendly, expect a greeter at the door and at least a few people in front of you at the register, but you will get out fast enough, its fast fashion, after all!|5
4 years ago|Richard Bavier|"This was a whirlwind of a shopping trip.  I went shopping the Sunday of the black friday weekend found three pairs of pants, a shirt and a cardigan. When I went to be rung up, they told me that if I brought in a bag of clothes to donate they would take an extra 15% off.  It just so happened that I had a bag of clothes to donate back in my car in Cambridge.  The cashier offered to hold my items while I got my clothes to donate.  Before leaving I asked the cashier what time they closed and she replied ""9 or 10. I don't remember"". So I went home, did some errands, ate dinner and grabbed the bag of clothes. At this point it was 7:40.  When I looked up driving directions back to the store, I saw that the cashier was mistaken and the store closes at 8 PM on Sundays.  After quickly driving over to back bay and I arrived at the store at 8:00 PM on the dot. The cashier who told me they closed at 9 or 10 was actually at the door and was initially not going to let me in.  She then remembered me and said she'd talk to her manager. Her manager, Kingston, was amazing. He came over, let me in, took me to the register, called over his coworker Jade to help me and gave me 15% off for my clothes donation.  Jade was also quite pleasant and helpful.  Kingston and Jade, you were absolutely wonderful and turned the whole experience around for me.  Cashier who's name I did not catch, everybody makes mistakes. Thanks for helping me."|5
