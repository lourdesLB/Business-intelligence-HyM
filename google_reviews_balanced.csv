review|class
lifts poorly located in the far corner. kids dept was far at the top level which should be located more conveniently. staff at the till in ladieswear were unfriendly and unhelpful. the 'system' was giving a higher price than the label and the assistant said the label was wrong - well you were wrong as the manager came to resolve! basic customer service training needed. i didn't feel i was a valued customer. then the assistant couldn't help to get another item from the upper level, 'i can't leave the till blah blah blah' - think outside of the box! i had 3 children and your store layout is ridiculous. your prices were not correct and items for the 3 for 2 promotion were wrongly placed which inconvenienced me and so i left them. 3 white tshirts for pe 2.99 and the next size up 9.99 which didnt make sense. very very dissapointed as all sizes upto 14+ are 2.99 online but the 3 for 2 and promo is not online! waste of time! staff should handle the situation better! i just want good service!|0
i experienced racism! it's so bad.. the cashier asked to use self check service but didn't help me remove the security tag! when i came back home i found it still locked on my clothes.|0
very unprofessional staff. manager kitty was such a rude person. her behaviour was very unprofessional. we brought something from the shop but forgot to take the tags off. apparently had to come back for this. member of staff checked everything and took it off. all of sudden another member of staff stopped us by the door and took the shopping away. asked to go to till in a very rude way regardless listening to our statement. even when we went to till she wasn't interested to listen straight way called manager (kitty) and there started interesting part. she came up to us with very loud voice like we stole million pound. we been requesting again and again to go and talk to her staff who sorted things for us. she was almost screaming with us front of all other customers and everyone was looking at us. tbh i felt so down. anyway at the end she apologised to us and admitted her mistake. if management watching this review then,all i want from h&m is to train those unprofessional, overexcited and uncivilised staff like kitty.|0
unprofessional staff, not all of them but the guy at ladies fitting room is very arrogant and he thinks the customers are his workers. very disrespectful. this happened on 5th nov at 18:30.|0
i bought 3 items at this store at around 8:30pm on 15 aug but the staff just packed 2 items into the bag. i came back to ask for camera check but they promised to check in the next day then contact me via my phone number even it was the last day i stayed there. there's no response until now, i cannot come back there to check. customer service here is poor.|0
nice place to visit but very poor children formal clothes quality and no options.|0
they seem to have sacked 80% of their checkout staff and replaced them with ineffective self checkout terminals that most people seemingly can't operate. i was queuing for about 20 minutes today with no movement before giving up and walking out. it's as if they are trying to make the retail experience so unpleasant that we'd rather shop online to save ourselves the frustration|0
terrible customer service. we struggled to self check and there was no one to assist us. after waiting over 5 minutes for assistance we had to go to try and find someone for help. we couldn't find anyone on the floor. eventually a very rude person came to the till to take our money, no hello, no apology, nothing! worst shopping experience ever. i would not recommend this store and i will never use the company again. appalling service and treatment!|0
customer service is appalling. i had questions about where the shoes were so i went up to a lady who i'm assuming was the manager (brunette, white) and she wagged her finger no at me and walked straight past me and i went up to another retail worker and she had a lot of attitude when i asked her. disgusting|0
one of their employees literally shoved me out of the way when i was looking for something and was very rude, you guys really need to sort your staff out|0
awful customers service. i was so chocked because the online customer service is really good. team member at the cash desk were having personal conversation and laughing out loud between them while serving customers . a manager with long brown hair came to authorised a refund and gave attitude to the customer without even talking the her. what an awful experience to be given attitude by someone in charge in the store .never ever again . i'll just keep buying on line. the perfect exemple showing why online business is taking over store's business.|0
complaint: about the staff members in h&m westfield stratford (). i asked the cashier () specifically to exchange an online item with an item in store, i left both items on the desk (making it even more obvious that i wanted an exchange) however she automatically returned it, and did nothing about it. i asked the manager, she was abrupt and did not resolve the issue instead was very blunt, that they can't do anything about it. they did not listen, instead they were very rude. i went earlier that day, and asked the manager and he said it was perfectly fine as long as the items matched the same price it was really sad, the other manager was not sympathetic at all, when i kept telling her my situation about my family relative, she abruptly repeated 'we can't do anything about it'.|0
very rude staff! i had a very bad experience in this shop. i love h&m and i am a loyal customer but when the people who work treat you disrespectfully you are very sad after! i have never seen a shop with more ugly staff than this!|0
i was at the stratford, westfield branch of h&m and a few young staff members decided to follow me around the shop, they never asked if i needed help, but they were always behind me as if i was going to steal something. i would like this matter to be taken seriously, as this is very racist and prejudice. if this happens again i will take serious legal action and will raise awareness that h&m has staff members who have unconscious bias towards a specific demographic. if come back again and treated the same way i will report you to the local government authority which owns the property. please train your staff to avoid childishly following black people, if they felt something was going to be stolen, they should have followed at a great distance so it won't ruin customer experience. i did not confront them about it as i did not want a commotion, but if i experience that treatment again i will make serious vocal complaint to media publications raising aware of the racism in h&m.|0
my mum was robbed at exactly 17:30 on the 4th of september in the stratford branch, and the staff showed no compassion. they've done nothing to help. this store clearly isn't the safest place to be in. pickpocketing is one thing but robbery is another. obviously the security aren't very useless. when my mum came home she was shivering; she had to walk because they took her phone and all her cards. she is diabetic and now she is scared to go out by herself. this is how hm treats their customers so poorly. my mum gave the full description of the culprit; it was a lady wearing the hijab but nothing has been done; instead the staff were showing attitude as if it was her fault she was robbed.|0
great products. second h&m in one day with rude staff on the entrance. we are all under the pressure but there 8s no need to be rude. just before that visited other shop from different brand with very nice and friendly people around. please work with your staff.|0
terrible customer service today. staff leaving till seven when massive queue. rude staff at till whispering behind customer back. ignored by staff member who was in front of me in downstairs till. 13:33 store gb0911 sa 132231 no 9259|0
"terrible experience. not only h&m has terrible return policy where you can't do straight forward exchanges. i bought something online on black friday sale, size was too big so wanted to go for smaller size. couldn't get it for the same price as originally as you can't exchange items. you need to return it and buy it again and of course price went back it original one. then you go to store to return item and code that is on my label didn't work. haven't been offered any alternative solution or apology. i was just left with: ""oh, the code doesn't work and you need to return it online"" send off. won't be shopping at h&m again. fix your return policy and poor customer service!"|0
the worse h&m i have ever visited, rude staff and that is the only way that they excelled|0
"horrible and unhelpful staff in the fitting room area ar h&m westfield stratford. two memvers of the staff today at 8.42pm, talking loudly about random conversations in front of me when i came to try some trousers. then i noticed that i needed a size more and they said they are closing and i cannot come back with the other said, it wasn't even 8.45pm yet! the only thing they said when i mention that i only needed a size more was ""sorry about that.."". it was definitely the most unprofessional service i've seen in retail and will not come back to this shop at all. there are plenty of retailers and definitely providing a better customer service!"|0
new store looks great. staff are useless. after waiting 30 minutes in a queue, i tried to use my westfield discount card. he denied it, called for a manager and waited 10 minutes and they didn't come. paid full price and a young boy left the security tags on the clothes! (kids wear department) need to make a trip back there tommorow now. salesman is 138933. ridiculous|0
got forced to open a membership account even though i refused and said i didn't need it. felt very pressured to have to waste ten minutes to open an account just so i could pay for my good.|0
"this h&m hassomany choices and varietiesjuat that the guy who was handling the trial room was very impolite and rude. as me and my sister were planning to enter the trial room to try the dresses he stopped us saying we can't go together which my sister did not understand what he was saying as other h&m stores always allows plus we had a baby. as she moved ahead he said "" do you understand what i am saying. sorry what is this way of speaking with client asking do you understand.? at this i was very surprised to his way of talking with the clients. sorry to say but please train that guy how to speak with clients and to use polite terms and gentleness in speach than trying to flaunt his style and rudeness. i lost the mood to even buy the clothes and i just tried them and hand it over to him. he needs to tone down his way of speaking. i don't know his name but he was speaking italian and had dreads hair. i wanted to complain right away but was so annoyed and upset that i just walked out of the store."|0
"hello, yesterday at 4.15pm while i was looking at selling clothes, someone stole my wallet from my bag. i immediately noticed your security guard that were near the exit . he wasn't helpful at all, just said"" what can i do?"". you should have cameras and view the recorded immediately because the thief was still in the shopping centre and even in your store to rob some of your other costumers."|0
absolutely appalling customer service!!! would never shop here again. this is the flagstore in london and was shocked to recieve such poor customer service by its sales assistant. waited in the queue for more than 20 minutes on the main floor with only 3 sales assistants on the till with over 20 customers waiting to be served. when i eventually reached the top of the queue one the sa's signed out leaving only 2 members of staff on the tills. what appealed to be a manager, mumbled over tanoy for other sa's to come onto the tills, no one arrived, the music was also too loud. waited a further 10 minutes to finally be served with what was an insensitive and crass sa. when i complained to her she was unapologetic, inconsiderate and unconcerned with the fact that loyal customers had been waiting for more than 20/30mins. wouldn't recommend this store in a million years. its a shame as h&m clothes are lovely and as the flagship store that represents london/england it has been thoroughly let down by its lack of well trained curteous staff. p|0
the staff has forgotten the tag on the clothes,didn't realised until i got home. so i had to returned and waisted 2h traveling because of staff mistake. the manger has just appologies,belived it should have been fair to pay for my time|0
rubbish customer service who laugh in your face for mistakes they make very unprofessional staff need training on communication and manners|0
i went to westfield stratford i always enjoy shopping at h&m today i went to the store i been served by lady called diena i bought two item to exchange one item was over 27 days i am only allowed to exchange i said that's fine when i bought new clothes she lift it on the and asked me to pay the deference then i said why did you not exchange she said in a rude way i already made the transaction i said then you have to refund this trouser and then i can exchange the item she gave me a dirty look i said you waste my time and yours time she rippled back in a rude way if you are not happy leave your feedback on the website and then i said you are rude can i see your manager she called the manager i said she is rude to me guy working next tell his name was t.j response was to me you are rude i saw you manger standing out there and doing nothing and everyone in the shop are watching us i said this is very unprofessional manger didn't say nothing apart for that what need to do i said leave it and he said its fine you can go lady i said i think your staff need costumer service training while i am leaving dienien gave me a dirty smirk and no apologise.|0
very very slow on the tills. lack of staff. if paying in cash is a nightmare waiting ages just to pay for 2 things|0
i happened to venture into there new store in stratford,. why do they put woman's clothing next to the mens ? i found the men's section cluttered and disorganised with a boring selection. i was informed by the staff when i managed to find one, to look online. what!!! poor customer service|0
whenever im buying anything from h&m the clothes after 3-4 weeks are not suitable to use anymore. plenty of holes everywhere etc. can't believe that primark is way better in terms of quality...|0
nice style poor poor quality for the prices they have!|0
hate this store.the security guard is useless and the store manager on the bottom floor is so rude and racist!! my phone got stolen and store manager didnt care made me go through more stress. never have been treated with that much disrespect i use to love going to this store before. never again!!! made a complaint to head office!!|0
staff can't calculate, i bye 3 for to, 2 of them 6 one 8, and i returned that from 8 for oder from 6, and payed them more re money how is possible i will never shop for h&m on stratford|0
poor shopping experience as the staff were non existent and disengaged.|0
ordered something on-line. wanted to return at the store as item not as expected. was advised i need to contact with the customer service after paying for the parking and spending time in a long queue. very disappointed.|0
very poor customer service , was there on friday 2 november 2018 between ( 6/7pm) , they had no bags in store . manager just keep saying sorry, no action , top of that they charged me 5p for a small paper bag ???? i thought we get charged just for plastic ?? felt so horrible , i had lot of stuff couldn't fit everything ( jackets / jeans / jumpers ) in small 5p bags . end up carrying everything in my hand ... so discussed|0
clothes are nice but music is far too loud. i see people leaving after having their eardrums burst just by walking into the store.|0
closing the fitting rooms att 45? make me sad that costumer service is this bad. not that sad about the fact that i'm not coming back tho.|0
came in for click and collect. after waiting for 10 minutes at the pick up point i had to queue up in order to speak to a member of staff. who then sent me back to the collection point and after a few minutes a very rude girl name adina came and made the experience even worse. i am extremely disappointed with the level of service provided.|0
rudest workers i've ever had to interact with.|0
everything in there is designed to make you feel ugly. it is terrible. do not enter.|0
shelves look like a jumble sale. staff rude, pushing past customers and grumpy at checkouts|0
google map pin is in the wrong location. this store is in westfield stratford. not near liverpool street station|0
plenty of metallica t-shirts but no metallica hoodie. disappointed|0
not great|0
worst hm in the world, staff is rude, the place is a mess, don't go there for the love of god|0
it was awful experience during covid. especially, manager erica!|0
every time i've popped into h&m, i've come across a store with no sales assistants.|0
very busy, nothing special, lots of sales but nothing that jumps out at you|0
not a great selection of man's clothing while female have two three floors..|0
never there!|0
very bad customer service, staff not professional, no manners|0
is there any staff who actually work here|0
rude staff in fitting rooms.|0
poor service|0
didn't go there|0
loud music makes it difficult to hear and be heard.|0
worst company|0
not there|0
too crowded|0
small size|0
rubbish|0
this is the wrong location!|0
absolute chaos|0
staff were so incredibly rude as if the atmosphere in and h&m isn't already awful enough. the new self check out is ridiculous and i felt judged by staff for not being able to use it properly like i'm supposed to know the procedures.|0
very little choice, no helpful staff in sight|0
they make poor quality clothes|0
"i visited on the 24th and bought a few items. the store itself was clean and everything was easy to find. i went to pay in the men's section. i was third in line. a member of staff highly encouraged us to use the self-service rather than speak to a person, quickly explained the process, and said she'd get me a bag. i scanned the first item, no luck, had to wait for the staff member. she's next to me, explaining to a man and woman how they're not using it right. it's at this point the staff member says, ""let him do it. men are better at it."" i was mortified. the staff member then has to stand and scan all my items for me as none of the barcodes work. she walks off as i pay and i am left waiting for a bag. i have to alert the cashier i originally wanted to buy from and they get me a bag instead. all three people could have been served by the cashier in half the time if this staff member had just left us alone. upon arriving home, i realize they haven't removed the security tags from two of my items. i now have to go back out (i'll be going to my local one in norwich, not this one!!) and get the tags taken off before i can wear my purchase. awful service and i can't believe what was said by your staff."|0
the cashier and some of the staff were racially profiling customers (black and brown mostly) and treated them differently had a very bad experience|0
very disappointed with 16th century fashion that has arrived at h&m. quality of clothes is a lot of the time questionable. however the shop is tidy and staff is nice|0
i wanted school uniform and they had nothing. thought they should of had a range at least. its a really big store.|0
"beautiful range of clothing and sizes the only problem was the staff at the tills. approached the tills with my items and two young girls were completely ignoring my presence while serving me talking about harry potter and what houses they were in the only thing i got from the girls were ""thats 15"" and a ""bye"" after i paid. either the manager didn't care for how they treat customers or they just have the poorest customer service skills ever and should the company should reconsider their staff or get them retrained"|0
store layout makes no sense, it is hard to find items and the never seems to be any staff on the shop floor to ask for help.|0
hardly any staff and only has plus sizes online and not instore which is quite discriminatory for modern day.|0
am starting to not like shopping here.. they seem to cater to people that only wear slim fit jeans pants.. i can't find a boot cut or straight fit jean's pants to safe my life.. and they only had one jacket line like really summer is over where are the winter collections?|0
"you'd think with this new much bigger store they'd have more staff but they don't. there's always a queue on every floorostly because these rarely more than 3 people on the check out. because it's a new store staff don't know where anything is and seem unwilling to show you. i was simply directed to ""upstairs"" when i asked for something. went check out and even tho the queue was more than 20 people deep, someone actually jumped off the cashier to hang clothes up. very annoyed!"|0
untidy shop with no customer service|0
don't like self check out. i'd rather be served by a human.|0
disgustingly busy, but it's the weekend. good range of clothes, even if not my style. the service was slow, even for a weekend. i'd avoid this place at all costs.|0
the h&m home section in the stratford branch is beautiful, but the staff in the home section are so unwelcoming. no smile and they make you feel awkward. really puts me off going there.|0
it so so there is not much things in a.y stores|0
although this branch has homeware, nightware, lingerie, sports and the usual men, women and children's, i was not impressed. been to better laid out and stocked branches.|0
the quality of clothes has gone down drastically since the pandemic, what a shame, it used to be my favourite store|0
never staff to help you. it's almost like they are shortly staffed|0
not much for grown ups here.|0
would give a 4 if they didn't leave security tags on items second time a row!|0
customer service is terrible!|0
good collection but bad customer service during the christmas, she didn't even look at me, and it wasn't busy.|0
it's good|0
nothing available over a 12. staff difficult to find and disinterested.|0
no options for petite taille|0
poor customers service|0
goood|0
always busy|0
the store is large and has a variety of goods, but the prices are very high|0
good prices but looking for clothes by size on the label is a struggle|0
very bad customer service at this store in london. if you are not in a hurry go to the h&m store at oxford street. the guys standing at the paying counter made us go back in the line after standing for 15 minutes for no reason. he just did not look at the line and moved us back. customer rep or sales guy name is talal. when we brought this issue up there was an indian/pakistani guy who was super rude with us and told us you should just break the line. i would suggest visiting better stores around with better customer support. pathetic after spending almost 150 pounds this was not worth the treatment.|0
terrible staff who were openly giving out about doing their jobs. no assistance with self-checkout. didn't see anywhere for tag removal and ended up leaving with tags on my items. alarms went and the security guard just told us to head on. he didn't think for a second that someone who has never done self -checkout for clothing may have left a tag on. great stock but the staff are incompetent.|0
"really disappointed with my experience at this store today. i saw 3 very sad looking plants reduced at 3 at the ""last chance"" section. i thought i'd save one and get a bargain at the same time. when i went at the till the manager rudely explained these were placed there by mistake and cost 22 each. i find this extremely overpriced for a dying plant. and there was lot of other sad looking overpriced plants too. i would not recommend plant shopping from h&m."|0
"i really love this shop so much however i went to return a bed set recently and was quite shocked at how rude the staff were. they said i couldn't return it because it wasn't in its packaging - she asked me i wanted to return it because it wasn't the right size. i said no it didn't suit my room and she continued to say ""you should really know the size of your bed before you purchase"" - first of all not what i said and second of all, so rude? she then said i can exchange it why is it now acceptable for an exchange and not return?"|0
seriously the most rubbish lint roller i have ever used!! cant even tear it properly where the dotted line is. cheap things always turned out to be more costly and makes one more angry.|0
had nothing instore worth buying. looked on every level from all around the shop floor- a waste of time. ended up going to a completely different store where some nice items of clothing were purchased.|0
dangerously overcrowded when i went there yesterday. h&m home store was packed and no one was following the one way system. children running around. staff and security guards did not social distance from customers. store was packed with so much merchandise and it's not even possible to walk past someone without being face to face inches away. and can't order online since lotsa stuff are out of stock in the app or online. disappointing shopping experience all round.|0
took forever to find a changing room that opened. the staff working in the changing room was super rude and dismissive.|0
the secutity man is very rude. i was simply asking where can i find kids corner and he looked quite annoyed. he even kinda yelled at me. i know i see the sign of kids but was so in rush just wanted to get quick help. he ruined my shopping|0
service in women's wear was good, staff were quite helpful, however the staff up in menswear were so rude and unhelpful. service made me feel very uncomfortable and as though the staff were being forced to work. really disappointing considering this is one od my favourite stores. will not be coming to this branch again.|0
very disappointed that h&m+ has been discontinued in store and is only available online! this is pure discrimination to women size 18+ who will now not be able to shop at your stores at all. disgusting!|0
was moved on my a member of staff as i was resting (heavily pregnant with twins) told to go to the changing rooms. terrible.|0
my experience at stratford shopping branch of h&m started fine on the day i shopped. however, i soon realised that one garment was scanned twice and when i went back into the store to rectify the mistake. the manager made me feel as if i was lying and she looked into my face and said let me check the cctv. she came back without any apology just''sorry for keeping you waiting i will refund your money now. is this the same treatment given to all customers? i will not be shopping in that branch again|0
i used to love h&m and shopping online. but recently when i ordered a parcel, it was supposed to be delivered by company yodel. it was terrible, they didn't deliver me anything, so i had to go all the way from london to kent to take my parcel on my day off! i wasted whole day and money on the train tickets. why this company even exists if i had to do their job? i mean, h&m was closer to me than the depot... i won't be shopping in h&m anymore until it doesn't work with this terrible company.|0
no clear signage for what floor men's department was. get down there and the service was so slow. took over 10 mins to be served and i was first on line!!!|0
loads of customers are dissappointed by yesterday's balmain event. poorly managed staffs who totally misguided customers. i expect floods of complaint n reduce their stars to 0 bcoz this store will badly damage h&m image in long term.|0
placed an order 2 weeks ago and i havent even received an email saying it has been posted out yet. was told it would arrive next day delivery. after all, that is what i paid for. avoid at all cost you have been warned.|0
staff not helpful. i asked at the checkout if there was another size of the item j was buying. girly was rude asked if i looked around the store. then said no.|0
poor and rude customer service from staff in the menswear department on floor 1 of the h&m clothes store on regent street. a lot of attitude shown to not only to myself but others who were being served in all three queues. how all three staff members got jobs in customer facing roles astounds me.|0
i was in the queue on 4th floor and there was 1 lady only in the cashier. i decided to try the cashier on 3rd floor, it was closed. on the 2nd, closed. so i went back to 4th. still one lady and when a second one came the first one left. at least 8 people in the queue. it took longer for me to pay than to find and try it on the dress i wanted.|0
"yesterday 26 of december 2015 so hard to gave 1 star """" they need to put option of """"mines"""" yesterday i had a shopping on the stor and i put all my shopping to the cashier .. i paid... and i want to get an other pair off shoes , i said to the cashier i will get an other one... i went i came back .. i didnt find the first pair wich i already paid..??? she was looking everywhere.. was not ther .. cause the cashier she is new and she is not even talk proper english .,;;; she get an other lady to ask her for help .. that lady said she will tcheeque the camera !!... she came back saying in the camera looks like i took the shoes..and she said she need to tcheeque in my bag !!!!! she was thing to find the shoe's in my bag .. she is such a stupid ... i could not enderstand that .. and she had a look and no shoes was ther then its my turn to play bad words ::: such a lier she said she saw me in camera taking the shoes and she didnt see wer is the shoes and she said the shoes is not on the store ! do i have magic stupid cashier . she was sckinny with long curly hair .. dont worry i m going on holiday and when i back i will get everything sorted by lawyer..."|0
changing rooms closed, so i'll buy elsewhere|0
this shop sucks. i was told to leave or carry my dog (she's 22 kilos, btw), though no sign at the entrance said so. they're just plain prejudiced, in here.|0
"how can this company say they are ecofriendly and ""conscious""? when they give you large plastic bags!!!! this is pure greenwashing"|0
picked up order.took longer than looking round shop for items.need to improve|0
very bad service, nobody was willing to help me find the size i needed, some members of the staff could barely speak english and others were really rude. disappointed.|0
your shop hours on google say you're open until 10pm on a saturday but you were closed by 9:20.|0
slowest service i have ever experienced. really not worth visiting the store.|0
clothes are terrible, customer service are useless and staff members needs to learn to take the sacurity tag off|0
the garments looks the same year after year.... the staff never says hi... the sizes weird... hmmm|0
"men's department let me quote my boyfriend: ""when you got 5 levels, you can shove the men in the basement in only one floor, in the dark"" the layout was a disaster, i think (as a woman) there should've been broader choices for smart/formal wear. but the worst part was the darkness and no mirrors. the lights were so dim, i kept seeing dark green whenever something was actually a black piece of clothing. and yes: - no mirrors. no actual mirrors. whoever was the interior designer, should get fired. they decided the columns of the building should get covered in ""mirrors"". while this works relatively good in the upper levels, in the ladies section - bright, proper classic mirror ""coloured"" mirrors there-, underground this ""mirror"" is one of those dark-grey/black reflective surfaces which already can't reflect nothing because of the poor lighting!! and besides - even if the lights were turned on properly (what's up, saving power? why not candlelight?...!) it still isn't a plain mirror, it is this dark tinted stuff! how the hell do you expect people to see if the blue matches your eyes? ... shame that in a world-class shopping street such blasphemy exists from h+m!! *insert here got shame .gif* good day!"|0
be careful with sales, they put full price items in between and then act like they don't know anything.|0
not enough for men|0
1 star for unpleasant staff. have been here 3 times in the run up for christmas, and they may be overworked, but been always rude. an example being: there isn't a living soul at the tills in the men's department, so you go one floor up, where they tell you, that the men's are one floor down, but in the end they do the return just the same. another example: you queue for the till to pay, where there are three cashiers in action, then after all the waiting the till gets closed by the shop assistant right in front of you, no explanations or apologies given. guys, this is really poor, but you'll be happy: i'll spend my money elsewhere next time.|0
staff members lost their tongue, they can't say hello to anyone.|0
a really poor selection of clothes in plus sizes... what a same..|0
terrible customer service by manager on duty|0
staff here must hate their job, and it shows|0
very bad|0
not the home store|0
to much people|0
racist staff|0
worst store|0
fast fashion|0
the music is so loud i suspect they're somehow trying to keep customers away i couldn't even have a proper look around the store because it was unbearable|0
"you are obliged to leave your things with the ""responsible"" of the fitting room and when you leave she simply loses your necklace and still blames you, as if you had lost the necklace. they should review the staff urgently!!!!!!!"|0
ummm idk why no cloth is fully organised and you can see 8 different design of a pants in same rack also if you want a different size the answer is no-no|0
clothes wern't displayed in an appealing and easy to find items. sizes were very limited and helpers were very limited in number. i won't go there again|0
"i went to buy a bag for my mum (xmas present) 3 weeks ago. when i went to pay for it, the cashier lady who i think had a high status in the shop (manager or something) nodded to another worker next to her as if you say ""look at this teenage girl buying this womanly bag"".i was going to say something but i was in shock. i had done nothing yet encountered such rudeness from staff for no reason ! i just looked at them but they just carried on laughing and giving each other looks. i had been to the store a few times before but after that, i'll happily spend an extra minute to walk to another h&m. they aren't the only one."|0
music in this shop is so loud i think the staff mistook it for a disco. had a very hard time shopping with such loud noise in the background, couldn't hear anything. if you've got low noise tolerance or are on a spectrum best to avoid it.|0
i do not like shopping. although i must say i do like that they let you charge your phone while you stop.|0
men's department needs improving. went to pick up a few cheap polo necks. had to look hard through the rail to find one without a mark on it. thought i'd found one, got to the counter to pay and guess what.....noticed a mark on the sleeve. cashier also left a security tag on one item so the alarm went off at the door and i had to go back inside and have them remove it. a big store with a decent selection of the usual h&m stuff but not a great experience.|0
store opens at 1130, but checkout counters don't open till 12. this isn't clearly marked though. the checkout counters are also inconveniently located.|0
needed a carrier bag as the one i was given had broken. was then quizzed about which items i bought before having to purchase another carrier bag.|0
for a flagship store in regent street, it's lacking in 'customer experience' and speciality.|0
not the best one around..small men department|0
small section for men|0
poorly organized|0
poorly stocked|0
always a queue at the till|0
same lines all the time|0
awful quality|0
basura trash|0
i loved these pants like loved them. i literally wore them a few times and just purchased them a month ago. but this morning when i already had my jeans on and ready to go i bent down to grab something and they ripped right by the pocket. i tried calling customer service but they said it would be difficult to do an exchange because i didn't have any tags(but i have the receipt). so yeah i won't be purchasing these or any of these again.|0
it's a sweden brand, which we boycott because their racist double standard government they let extremist burn the holy book|0
only 2 cashiers working in the busiest time of the year. absurd|0
had an unfortunate experience. bought three pieces of boxer shorts for the price of two. one of the pieces of clothing was damaged when i opened the box, and i obviously wanted to change that pair for a new one. however i had to pay some dollars to get a new pair of shorts.|0
i bought a shirt that said it was supposed to be 12.99 but the total came to 18.04 and it said i bought 2 items but i only bought 1|0
actually bad customer experience. wont spend time and money here. i know customers are a lot today but that should not be not an excuse.|0
worst experience. never visit. anthony the manager is so disrespectful and abusive.|0
i want to know why you have 2 floors, ample men's clothing, ample women's clothing, a section for accessories, even a housewares section. but 0 plus size options. it's really overdue for mainstream retailers to be inclusive. i don't need to try on a duvet cover, i do need to try on clothes that fit my body. i shouldn't have to explain to a global retailer in 2019 how awful it is to be having a fun shopping day with your friends on newbury street and need to sit out when they hit your store just because you're not the same size as your friends.|0
this store's manager is the most impolite employee i've met at h&m. he treats customers like garbage; as if he were doing a favor to them|0
yesterday 10/21 around 11am i had a bad encounter with a sales associate/supervisor working the fitting room. i had several garments including a hat, to match an outfit i was considering in purchasing. associate stated i was not allowed to go into the fitting room with the hat to try on, not knowing i previously worked at h&m and know the fitting room policy. so i asked him how would i be able to try on the hat with the outfit then, he stated i can go in the fitting room put on the garments i want to try on then call him and he will bring the hat, then take the hat back. which did not make any sense. later after i purchased the hat he didn't allow me to try on, i informed him i previously worked at h&m and know that you are allowed to go into the fitting room to try on hats with out being monitored, i had ask to speak to a supervisor to make a complaint not knowing he was actually the supervisor on shift. sales associates including supervisors should never profile a customer like that as you can lose sales. yes i looked young and i am african descent doesn't mean i plan to steal a $12.99 hat. which everyone knows anything over $9.99 has sensors on them. he told me if i still have an issue just call customer service to make a complaint and have a nice day (sarcastically). employees like that should be addressed and properly trained on discrimination and customer service skills.|0
you mean to tell me i can go to braintree with less selection than a flagship location and find just what i need? horrible service hot and not shopable. clothes on the floor and customer service is -100. i hear the emplyees complain about how they hate it there and cant wait to leave. obviously they need more people that loves there job. and can help me find a basic shirt without having to ask 10 different people. gotta love low budget fashion|0
horrible experince! the lady at the fitting room was so awful and mean. i had over seven items and she said that i would have to try on the rest of the items later which i was completely okay with. later i was underdressed so i politely asked if she could hand me the other items in exchnage for the items i had already tried on, she looked at me and said that i would have to come out and get them myself! i was liteally five steps away from her! later when i stepped out to get my stuff, she asked how many items i had i said six and she would not believe me so she made me, so she counted all the items herself. i feel offended and never had such an expereince at h&m.|0
-collection of clothes is [personally] not pleasing. -the layout of things makes it difficult to move around. -employees could not found anywhere when their help was needed.|0
rude staff, pathetic collection, over priced|0
while purchasing a white hoodie the cashier dragged it on the counter top so now theres blue pen marks on the back ...........|0
inefficient stuff, the female manager is extremely unhelpful with the refund issue, super disorganized store management|0
you should really provide a toilet for consumers.|0
very slow customer service store is a mess !!|0
they suppose to close at 8:00 pm on sunday and i went to the store about 7:00 pm and the security guy told me they were already closed|0
i was seriously disrespected by a male employee. better to just order online|0
no chairs in that place.|0
rude staff, bad quality of clothes. keep away|0
they always open the doors late!!|0
stupid and disrespectful employee|0
look for another h&m|0
they offer horrible service. they can't refund with apple pay and the guy told me to get a temporary physical card from the apple store. but the guy lied because apple store doesn't have such service. i will never buy anything from the h&m.|0
store manager assume costumers as liar|0
lack of a lot of items and extremely unpleasant sellers|0
they need to hang their long coats/dresses somewhere higher. this is gross. buyers, beware if purchasing long items like these. otherwise, it is a decent h&m with a large selection of items, and a great team of employees.|0
this place has a really good collection on a random day and no good collection at all on other days. considering that this place is always crowded and billing line is always huge, they don't have staff on the first floor for billing ok weekdays which makes it look like it is crowded all the time|0
long wait in line even with 4 registers open. same as zara down the street. be prepared to wait. the mostly gen z workers just move extremely slow and unmotivated. asked for a bag, she forgot to give me one, and then bowed to me buddhist style and got it passive aggressively. weirdest interaction i've ever had in a store.|0
"extremely rude and unhelpful staff working in the fitting rooms. also, it's impossible to go there with friends to see wheather things look good on them or not because ""it's not allowed to go into the fitting rooms area"", which is weird coz it's allowed in pretty much every single hnm i've ever been to."|0
only went in here for a few men's tees. it was so crowded you could hardly move and huge lines for the fitting rooms. clothing racks are over-flowing and crowd the entire store, so not much room to move through the store, so good for a quick in-out visit, but wouldn't be very relaxing to actually browse around. got the tee's we needed though.|0
sure it's big, and has a great range, but the floor service was dismissive and unhelpful, and the checkout service was appallingly slow, and the girl just stuffed the clothes into a bag without even folding them. but to be honest she was much more interested in joining her colleagues in conversation about anything but what was happening in the store. h&m needs a secret shopper to kick the backsides of these lazy staff and protect the brand.|0
chronically understaffed and extremely hot and humid. i almost passed out waiting in line to check out.|0
if you need clothes that are moderately overpriced, this is a fine choice. but generally the culture and values that they project seem to emerge from this sad combination of mindless fashion, body shaming and copratism. and one can only assume that any money you spend there will go towards advancing those unfortunate values.|0
i like this store because they have children cloth, but i had several problems here, like they left the alarm tag on several times and they didn't put all the items in the bag (that happened to me twice, once i paid for a shirt which wasn't in the bag and another time i thought i'd bought a shirt, which wasn't in the bag when i got home... so many mistakes here!|0
it was crowded. the place was a disaster and the workers were stuck up and rude.|0
the selections are amazing but the customer service is horrible. everyone acts as if they have something better to do than assist customers|0
so sad mens collections are very (gappy) so generic. repeat repeat. so gap. please bring fashion back. forward, trends, and design.|0
never enough fitting rooms, men selection is sparse as hell|0
associate at check out , seem , not interested. no thank you , nothing!|0
the men's options here is really small|0
messy organization. limited variety of sizes and products. bad service|0
no real method to where things are placed..2 floors of disorganization|0
sales associate not aware of actual discounts|0
nice price but racist employee|0
mediocre, expensive clothing.|0
expensive|0
what a mess...|0
junky|0
i would not shop here. the commercial has the most horrific looking outfits and the black haired women is so hard to look at...for goodness sakes please do something with those eyebrows. just poor fashion and taste all around.|0
i came to h&m lakeland and it was the worst experience. the fitting rooms close 40 minutes before the clothing store closes. the customer service was terrible. and the teens that work there don't have any customer service skills and have a terrible attitude. i came with my mom from out of the country and it was a horrendous experience.|0
basically, the mall is 2 steps away from closing. nothing in it is worth anything. and unless you want chinese food, there's not much to choose from to eat. there is now 5 chinese fast food places in the food court, and that's about it. go to brandon, tampa or orlando. this place sucks.|0
this is my experience after trying to get in contact with the mall manager over several phone calls, none of which were answered or returned. i have sat in the mall management office for 10 minutes now with no offers for assistance. one of the employees looked at me through his door, then looked down and dramatically exhaled, clearly showing contempt for their customers. he closed the door, and i could hear what sounded like it couldn't be anything but a belt being fumbled with, and then a zipper. some unnamed representative finally came up to speak with me, and she told me that performing permits aren't distributed, despite a security officer having told me they can be. i am not just fighting for myself, i want to get a shade put up over the bus benches so other people and i won't have to suffer, baking in the insane heat that florida is famous for.|0
i'm a fan of the fye store and finally went around the entire mall recently with my service dog and my mum. the dillard's is like something out of an early csi (original) episode, kinda creepy, mysterious stains, and smells like dead something. the staff i encountered throughout the mall were really friendly and had great service dog etiquette. i was shocked to learn that they pretty much just let any dog inside because the owners didn't educate them about service dog laws (did a quick run down with a security guard and claire's employee, misbehaving dogs, sd or not, can be asked to leave). after we grabbed a quick lunch at the food court, i was disgusted to spot my service dog investigating a bunch of bugs crawling across the floor. after that, we promptly left. i doubt we'll return. the staff we met were nice, polite, and helpful, but bugs around food is not okay.|0
i purchased a bathing suit in miami and tried to return it since i didn't use it but no one informed me of he no bottom return until i went to return it in lakeland. i just want to know why the hell would you return the top not the bottom that's a stupid policy. people try on them bathing suits in the store but you all won't return them. i will not purchase from here anymore due to that stupid policy and because when i purchased the bathing suit the policy should have been told to me and i wouldn't have purchased it i would have went elsewhere. never again. make sure this policy is told to your customers because i wouldn't have know until i purchased the bathing suit since the policy isn't posted up in the store but only on the back of the receipt.|0
(2019) the locator thingy is in the wrong spot. size wise it would be ideal for h & m to take over the sears spot since sears is finally closed but otherwise i'm leaving this a 4 star until it's moved to the exact location on this map. after that, i'll take my comment & rating down. (note: my rating doesn't reflect the store & employees so please check them out.) ________________________________________ (2020) .... ok. i'm guessing the store owner must not had posted the location of the h&m cursor because my comment is a year old and it's still located on the wrong side of the map. nothing has came to where the cursor is currently at and h&m is located near j.c.penney.|0
extremely rude and loud employees, below average clothes that fit a minimal amount of people, and cheap and rough fabrics. the only good thing is the jeans but i'd say to order the online because the experience in stores are just awful|0
i tried the store because it said it had plus sizes now but they're plus sizes are nowhere near plus sizes. it's for the younger possibly chunkier junior plus not women|0
to start this off i would like to say i am a black man raising a beautiful young black boy. growing up i was called monkey not because i was active but because the racial undertone of what it represent. i can give a short history lesson on how african americans had to prove that we were actual humans and we were perceived to be equivalents to monkeys. they even put children in a zoo in cages throwing bananas at them,spitting, and throwing rocks at them while spitting racial slurs. for a company that big who has people to research things like this should of caught this early because honestly this information and correlation isn't hard to find. so for the lack of care and respect for a specific racial demographic. this place will never get a penny from me. not a good company for ne...|0
the store was a mess, clothes on top of racks, accessories on the ground. waited for 15 minutes in the checkout line at such a small location. i could not believe how disorganized and sloppy this store is.|0
nothing that would attract tourist or even locals to this mall. very boring. if you are retired nice nap too sit and soak up some free air conditioning.|0
this place has gotten worse and worse over the years. the clientele does not support any sort of high end shopping and any nice stores don't last more than a year lately.|0
i used to love this location but the cashier treated me so rudely. tell your customers that what they are buying is non refundable before you sell it to them. the cashier got so snippy with me|0
its a mall. no security ever seen allowing punks to throw fireworks at sleeping infants. oddly specific? you better believe it.|0
if you go there during the day or monday through thursday its a nice place...forget the weekend's security does not control the adolescents.|0
let's get some stores in there that everybody wants to go to not the handful of rednecks that still live in this town we don't need a camouflage store in the lakeland mall, want this mall to be flourishing and booming put stores that people go to, need a hint go to the brandon mall that's where i drive.|0
y'all better teach a certain black security guard how to talk to another man's woman before he loses some teeth.|0
the mall is not the same anymore. all they have is high price stores in there. all the good stores left|0
this mall is so junky, plus it has no good variety of stores to shop at. you're better off going to tampa or orlando mall|0
they never have my size so i'm going to stop going to this hm location. i might stop going period if all stores are alike|0
expect your car to get broken in, expect annoying ass teenagers, expect nasty people here. the stores suck, and they are dirty. don't bother.|0
mall is closing many of it's shops. quality of the products available is very low end.|0
place is rundown and outdated with about 50% of all the stores closed down. terrible mall.|0
very little inventory for men and the fitting rooms were closed|0
went to the carnival $30 for a wristband and my granddaughter could only go on 4 rides.|0
a place where you can wait in line and no one be at the register for more then 15 min. that will be the last time i come here|0
could not get any help when we were at sears. not shopping there anymore. they have nothing|0
its depressing to describe in one word. ugliest mall ever.|0
lots of stores closing. only the food court is ok|0
google maps is failing again. i wasn't even there. this is happening a lot lately.|0
worst mall ever it is so hard to find stores in that mall.|0
horrible mall, dirty and the customers there are not nice|0
this place has gone waaayyy downhill and they need to knock it down and start over.|0
if you dint buy something as soon as you see it, youll lose it.|0
racks were so full couldn't even look at the clothes.|0
not impressed with variety for plus size women|0
smells like an old attic. crappy flea market stores.|0
shabby, only a few good stores left.|0
was better as burdines. represented florida style better|0
just stopped for a quick look.|0
nothing there for young folks really dead environment|0
grossest mall i've been to.|0
this used to be a mall. thanks, amazon!|0
we need a new mall!|0
the comic shop is out of business|0
dark and dank not well lit|0
another poor place to shop.|0
not a very nice place|0
too small|0
that good|0
run down and dirty|0
its aight|0
not as nice as use to|0
dirty.|0
needs updating or to be demolished.|0
a sad and tired place.|0
never been there|0
ok|0
dump|0
boring|0
over priced|0
not what it used to be.|0
its empty...|0
poor staff|0
ghetto|0
ghost town|0
siempre vacio. no me gusta para nadaaaa always empty. i don't like it at all|0
a lot of empty spaces. poorly and sparsely placed directories. nothing for kids to do. stores are cool, but even they offer less selection than they use to. great please for senior walkers, very few customers in the way. it's a shame. this place used to be a really cool place to shop. owners are doing another to prevent it's demise.|0
great location but... another sad example of the failing of retail stores. macy's was shut down. burlington is sloppy & smells unclean. much of the outside of the mall has a look of abandonment. if i could, i'd inject some life into this area with a couple beautiful dine in restaurants, some high end retail and a facelift to beautify the outside.|0
went to take my daughter homecoming dress shopping. there were slim pickings for stores. everything in the mall is marked down for store closing. you might be able to find a good deal.|0
it's a good mall but in most of their stores tney need to keep it more clean and orginized, i know it's not their fault that some costumers leave a mess but it still looks bad to not tidy up the place and lately in most of their stores there is no cashier or employee in sight to help out.|0
there is not a good selection of stores in my opinion. there are also lots of empty spaces. i will stop in at times to visit one or two stores, but gone are the says if spending a morning or a day shopping at this mall. the couple of stores that i visit are on one end of the mall. i can park on that end, visit the two stores, then leave. some of the other stores that i usednto visit have moved across the street.|0
it's a bummer because this mall does have so much potential with it's location right off 98, but this just feels like a dying mall. there is an entire wing of the mall that is vacant, and then some of the stores i just can't imagine anyone actually visiting. i would much rather go to lakeside or travel to one of the outlets than visit this mall near my home.|0
this mall has gone downhill over the years. it has the big chain stores that you'd expect, however all the good shops in between the big stores have abandoned and seems like a flea market with a jc pennys and macy's..etc.|0
update the closing information, it closes at 8 pm.|0
great stores, but maintenance is crappy. only 1 soap dispenser works in ladies room, half the sinks do not have water, only 1 working hand dryer out of 3.|0
when you see how empty it is getting..... take note don't scurry your customers away just so you can close on time. how about actually staying open another hour or two so customers can finish shopping. not everyone has banker hours and i am in line with plenty of other customers as we are being driven out of the businesses. i'm done spending my money where someone doesn't want my business.|0
little to no stores, half the mall was empty, the food court was the best part. the theater is a nice touch as well, saving grace for a fading mall|0
the mall is dying. could be a sign of the times, or mismanagement, but with the major end stores closing, the mall should be an incubator for more local businesses and updated chains.|0
i don't care for this mall at all they need new stores how many shoe stores do you need. it's like the mattress firm one every 100 feet|0
not enough options 4 plus sizes. shoes waaaaayyyyy out of range!! burlington needs better prizes for shoes, really!!|0
a lot of empty spaces that used to be shops. bored store employees standing around because business is so bad. this place has gone downhill fast.|0
i've visited this store multiple times since it opened and have yet to find anything my size. i'm not plus size but i'm not a size 2. also, this store is european so add about 2 sizes to your normal size.|0
i used to love to shop here until they made most of the food asian food and got rid of so many good stores!|0
it's unfortunate, but this mall is fading out. used to be a great shopping experience. not so now.|0
went on a sunday looking for the hallmark store. parking lot was mobbed, frustrated drivers going every which way looking for parking spaces. a real circus, so we left.|0
they need to fix the a/c in dillard's. it was musty and damp not as bad in the inside walking area but inside the stores was bad|0
great place to walk around and window shop. alot of neat little stores.|0
why isn't someone cleaning the entrances...trash, cigarette buds, overflowing garbage...and the plants can someone attend to them...and how can a person try to clean a table if you are not looking at it...made it worst...sad...|0
i never really liked the area, and there is a poor selection of stores to shop at. also, the clientele do not support any type of high end shopping or stores.|0
the malls has gotten so run down and dirty on the outside it make me not want to shop there. hardly cars there ever and if there is its the employees.|0
macy's recently closed down. the mall lighting is very dim. i only go there for crazy 8 and the shoe stores.|0
clothes are basic looking but overpriced. look somewhere else that doesnt have boring clothes.|0
it was fun it just needs nicer security with a smile they look kinda mean lol|0
dead. dining is a joke. stores are a joke. constant closures and moving of stores. meh, i suppose the 80s and 90s had to die sometime.|0
i travel for work a lot, and this is one of the worst malls i've been to. the layout is strange, not very clean.|0
only have clothes that will fit a skinny teenager...anyone over size 36 waist is screwed|0
this store is too crowded and discombobulated to find anything, it makes my ocd go into overdrive.|0
loud music. no plus size or business wear. nice staff.|0
feels kind of dirty and unkept, amount of store options are not great.|0
went to jcpenney. they employees were a little rude. ended up putting stuff back up and walking out.|0
this mall is on life support. no real great stores.|0
very crowded but you find cute stuff here|0
one dead mall. macy's just closed there and it doesn't look like the rest is far behind|0
outside not well kept / clean inside dirty water marks on ceiling too many closed store fronts|0
those mall is dying. macys closed down here.|0
not a big selection of name brand stores.|0
one of the worst malls i've ever been too|0
not much going on in this mall. it needs an upgrade.|0
compared to all the malls in the bay area, this one is down there on the bottom of the list.|0
store brand names keep closing and being replaced with small stand up shops.|0
looks like it is closing. very few stores anymore.|0
when are the owners gonna just take the tax break and shut this poor place down?|0
nice facility but very empty.|0
clothes are not in plus size and they are a little expensive|0
too small, hardly any room to walk|0
came here for christmas shopping, it's so dead and no shops for guys|0
not very clean. shady people walking around.|0
meh. not a huge selection. rather go to orlando.|0
pretty much dead. not much of a mall|0
very old style. needs remodeling bad!|0
its old lots of shops leaving the mall|0
it sure has changed over the years|0
small mall but okay|0
too many stores leaving.|0
the worse customer service ever|0
lakeland needs an upgraded mall.|0
it's ok|0
clean your play area...|0
maintain situational awareness.|0
there's just nothing anymore|0
dirty, nasty, filthy, gross!|0
not many places to shop|0

stores closings|0
cada dos semanas voy al mall y lo q no me agrada es que los alrededores estan sucios basura donde quiera en la entrada del mall necesitan tener una mejor apariencia tienen buenas tiendas y por dentro del mall se ve muy bien al igual la comida solo es ese detalle de limpieza every two weeks i go to the mall and what i don't like is that the surroundings are dirty garbage everywhere at the entrance of the mall they need to have a better appearance they have good stores and inside the mall it looks very good as well as the food is just that cleaning detail|0
"i went in this evening to do a quick exchange around 7:00pm. i asked the cashier in the womens section (brown girl i think she's pakistani or something. she had the accent as well) where on the floor i can find the item i was trying to exchange. she literally rolled her eyes and told me ""i don't know go ask someone working in the fitting room."" i was in a rush and didn't have the time to discuss this with the manager, but thankfully the sweet manager or assistant manager who was by the fitting room helped me with my item. she was a lovely lady and i wish they would train their employees to have this type of customer service. that's all."|0
the asian woman in the fitting room staff is quite odd. i understand if two people aren't allowed in the same fitting stall, however, what i don't get is why she only calls out certain people and not everyone else. if more than 1 person isn't allowed in the stall stay consistent and say that to everyone who is doing it or just shut your mouth.|0
charging for a paper bag and not telling you. why do big companies try and draw every cent from you.|0
cashier was very rude and overall a disappointed experience. i hope someone can look into this and solve the problem. here is the screenshot of the store where it happens and the information need it to see what sale representative assist me with my purchase.|0
my dinner was good. but the service and service time was horrible. maybe short staffed? but after we sat for our reservation, other tables started arriving around us, and they got service before us.... drinks and food orders.|0
horrible return policy. i went to exchange an item ordered online hoping to get store credit but i was told it was not possible. employees were helpful and it's not their fault but i do think that they should have a better return policy for online orders as it also costs $ to ship it back when most places don't charge|0
took my daughter out shopping after boxing day. when has it become ok to charge a customer $0.10 for a bag? maybe coming from the suburb i feel really offended?! i spent over $200, did they think that i should carry the clothes bagless? does h&m believe that they can recuperate enough bag money to cover for their losses in asia? eventually my daughter will out grow h&m and i certainly expect that like gap, h&m will be a distant memory. good luck collecting 10 cents per bag because you definitely offended this customer.|0
management issues, suddenly you find that the fitting room is closed!! they cant blame covid this time! who buy clothes without trying them first!!|0
change rooms have loose curtains that leave many peep holes :(|0
the worst customer service, very arrogant while they serving talks about there personal life, i try to talk to the manager with my problems issues but i couldn't find 1 person to listen my concern. i ll never shops in that store.|0
very bad customer service. i have brought some clothes and security stopped me as claimed tag on the clothes did not remove. i showed her my receipt but she told me to go to cash counter agin. i went there and ask the cashier to remove the tag, she said there is no tag then i ask her to come with me to security girl or talk to ger that nothing wrong she said she can't leave that place nor talk to her. then i asked to take the clothes and refund me as i don't want to get bothered agin. it was very unprofessional customer service.|0
"they ran this marketing campaign saying take home to try on and return if they don't fit. brought two pairs of pants home that didn't fit, try to return them and was told that they were ""worn"" and that ""we can't accept those for return"". bait and switch marketing tricked me into 'buying' two pairs of pants that were too small. i had just signed up for the loyalty program as well, but now i won't ever be shopping at h&m again, which is a shame because i liked their products. but my hand is forced... would you put up with fraudulent marketing? i'll be convincing as many friends as possible of this as well, and contacting the bbb."|0
very inconsistent return and exchange policy. i was told that i could exchange the products (socks on final sale) when i bought them. however, when i went to get them exchanged, the staff said i couldn't. staffs are very impolite and unhelpful. bad experience. would have given no stars if possible.|0
some friends and i spent about 2 hours in this store; not a single person greeted us on the sales floor, no one acknowledged us for several minutes when we walked into the fitting room even though there were 5 people chatting in there behind the table, and a pretentious guy working took a rail and walked it between my friend and i, forcing us to move out of the way, and he didn't even say excuse me or apologize for forcing us out of his way even though he had more than enough room to go around. the girl at cash was extremely friendly though (alexa?), almost nice enough to make up for the mediocre service from everyone else working. i expected more from a flagship h&m location.|0
"i should say customers shouldn't drop anything in the store!! one of the staff here is super rude with extremely bad attitude!! i almost felt like talking to the manager due to this experience. i see why people say that the h&m staff at eaton centre is horrible!! if i can give 0 star, i would....i would give the big store a 4 star, though... however, they really need to have a good team of staff working as well. back to the experience.. first of all, i am pretty sure that the clothes were not balanced well. just a little touch and everything fell down. i was shocked and couldn't react at that moment.. there was a nice customer who helped and at first i thought he was a staff, so i let him do his job.. then the ""real"" and rude staff come by to help and was so super rude!! pin pointing that a customer who was standing right there dropped the clothes and still looking! i would have totally helped if there were only one staff!! but there were 3!!! either way, that guy shouldn't treat a customer who is right there with those rude comments. i will never come back to shop at this h&m as the respect we get here to shop is not worth spending!!!"|0
"pathetic customer service skill by a store manager andrea. i went to the store to redeem my birthday discount for 25%. at first she said i could only do that online, then i showed here where it clearly said i can also redeem that in store. when she was not able to scan the bar code due to some glitch on their end, instead of owning up and honoring the discount she exactly said these words ""well i don't run the app and you can come back later if u like"".not only it upset me but i was also sad to learn that people like her are running a brand like h&m"|0
horrendous customer service. they advertise that they do curbside through instacart yet the app itself is terrible and inaccurate. called the store directly and was told they can work with me to buy what's in store through instacart. i did research, made a list, called back and unfortunately got a different, terrible, lazy and obnoxious rep in the men's department who didn't want to do a single thing to help... what else do you have to do during a shutdown? how is the messaging so inconsistent? don't advertise curbside if you don't have it or you hire employees who would rather get paid to lie and be lazy instead of doing their actual job! also once again...instacart is terrible!|0
this place is the worst. i was just shopping for 2 hours in the store and my shopping bag was gone seconds after i left it unattended. i told it to a customer service rep. by the look on her face, seemed like she was doing a huge favour to look for it in the fitting room and a cashier. when asked for a manager - she said it was only a customer who could take a shopping bag at this point. so i have one question: then why did the stuff look for it in the places like fitting room? i just felt very unwelcome and nothing was done to help me to recollect items missing either from a rep or from a manager. if only i was there for 15 mins i wouldn't care that much..|0
honestly, i'm not sure how h&m survives. really poor customer experience. $5 is charged to return on online item (very small print that i hadn't noticed before), no in-store returns, random cancellation of order when items that are in-stock then magically out-of-stock. worst service. forgot about the terrible sizing, bad odour from clothing items, etc.|0
"horrible snobby sales associate, i ran into today. not one smile on her face. she didn't even look at me. the total was $35.90, so i gave $40.90. she grabbed the $40 out of my hand so quick the change dropped on the security tag remover and it got stuck, the whole time she was huffing and puffing and rolling her eyes. so i said "" well you shouldn't have grabbed my money out of my hand so aggressively"" she then proceeded to throw my clothes in the bag, so i snatched it from her so fast she didn't know what happened. this isn't the first time. terrible customer service. half of these comments are about the customer service in a negative way... it should be a clue to the establishment."|0
i haven't went out to shop in a mall since quarantine started, so it was weird to see so many security guards which i didn't mind. however, the moment i walked in, i saw the security guards running around as if they were chasing someone but they seemed lost. i ignored it and went on my merry way, at the time i was wearing a side tie top and it started getting loose so i found a mirror to retie it. and that's when a security guard stood right beside me and stared at me the entire time i fixed my top. i asked if she needed something and she just ignored me and stared. i've never felt so uncomfortable at a mall in my life, horrible experience. never going back|0
mapleview mall location are rude with costumers|0
sell great merchandise however h&m at the dufferin mall are *way to strict with return policy* must always have the receipt , even if item is new unworn with tix attached. and socks are final sale which is very odd.|0
h & m manager (a lady on duty) in sherway garden mall was very rude in behaving with us as well as customer. when their associate said that if we could find new sales item they could exchange those items (even though final sale!) as we cordially requested for the exchange . we spent time to find out items but that sales associate gone for break so manager came to deal with us and did not care about what their sales associate explained to us. she was very rude and disrespected us. she didn't even allow us to buy another new items from the store since i said they were wasting our time which was absolutely right as their associate involved us to find items so she could help to exchange but manager did misbehave . if i were the main manager i could have fired her and gave her relief because of bad customer service. she should learn how to deal with customers.|0
i had a horrible interaction around the holidays. i'm only writing about it now because i work in retail and can't stop thinking about how bad this store is. i admit i should have tried on this pant before i bought it, but the sales associate was incredibly misleading. she said i could exchange the item if it didn't fit. well, it didn't. so i went back the next day. it was a size 12... i'm a small at roots so i don't know why i'm a 12 at h&m, but size 14 is not sold in the store (only online which is also dumb). i wanted to exchange for another style to see what fit. i talked to a meek young man, who suggested i try stuff on and he called his manager. well after trying on 8 pairs of size 12 pants the manager tells me over the walkie talkie that i actually can't exchange my item. she didn't even show her face. i will never shop here again. not only was i lied to in the first place, but the manager is obviously setting a horrible example of customer service and now i'm stuck with an ok mug and a cheese board i don't even use. oh yeah, i went back a few days later and spoke to some slacker associate who let me exchange for a mug and a cheese board (cuz i obviously cannot buy clothes there. and never will). if you need customer service training, take a peek in this store for some examples.... of what to avoid.|0
no privacy in change rooms. the staff was pleasant and it was clean and orgnized despite this i will not return. the curtains in the changerooms are impossible to fully close. i struggled to not look in on others changing and knew they could also see me changing. increadably uncomfortable and exposing.|0
i bought a coat that i paid cash for, i tried to return the coat because it did not fit me but i had lost the receipt. the staff did not give me any options to help me mend this situation. they were rude and disrespectful to me because i have an accent. i have never felt so belittled before in my life, it made me very upset.|0
"i have been trying to talk to a sales associate for 2 days now, to check in-store availability of an item. these were the least helpful associates i have ever come across, and i've worked in retail for a long time. not a single one of them was willing to help, but kept passing me along to another ""department"", which resulted in about 15min-20min of hold time to a destination where associates didn't pick up the call. then i was bounced back to another phone line - where i started - where the associate put me on hold again to try and patch through the department that didn't pick up in the first place. they didn't pick up again, so once again i was passed back to the ""main"" line where they put me on hold again and then hung up. this has happened 4 times now. for a flagship store, this is unacceptable. ridiculous even. you should not be this disorganized."|0
cheaply made items. seems to offer clothes for very thin/skinny people only. rude staff.|0
worst customer service ever, made me want to never shop at h&m again! the first sales associate was rude to me and the other did the math wrong on my purchase. they really need to teach them how to treat a customer and basic math.|0
"absolutely terrible staff puts my items back by mistake responds by ""i dont know where it is; its my first day""!!!!! manager took ownership after i informed him would never everrrrr shop online they charge 15% tax in ontario lol really bad online shopping experience $4.99 restocking fee... ridiculous!!! lesson learned: never shop here music is outragously loud and annoying in their stores"|0
"the worst h&m i have ever ever step foot into. if i could rate 0 stars i would. you get no help.. not even a smile... i was trying to get a pair of jeans off the highest rack with 2 employees just staring at me .. not even offering to help. get to the cash and had to deal with this girl named ""cherrie"" classy name for a classy girl... she was so ignorant and when she refused to take my american visa ... she got so annoyed when i had cash. are you serious ? never ever ever again ."|0
nothing i hate more than a cashier with the attitude that they are doing you a favour cashing you out. thank you. you should be saying it first- not me. why are these kids so awkward and un-mannered ?|0
i never saw one employee in the store .it's like it's been run by invisible staff .|0
misleading staff. not cooperative manager is not cooperating and refused me badly for exchange which was promised by the staff. i was regular customer but will never go to dundas hnm branch because of bad behavhior and wrong dealings|0
terrible customer service. they make mistakes when you ask them to hold items, they don't know online promotions that can be used in-store (e.g., coupons), and they seem to lack common sense when it comes to deciding whether or not to honour prices on their website unless they get a manager involved.|0
very rude manager. false advertising, then discarded me, for his or the store mistake, very impolitely|0
not accepting online returns, despite their website and return packaging stating that it is allowed.|0
i wish the changing room staff could be polite, ultra rude.|0
used to carry a variety of sizes, now suited to only skinny people. not cool.|0
h&m is using factories which physically abuse their (mostly female) workers - watch footage from netflix documentary 'the true cost' for video evidence.|0
the security guy follows coloured woman and the guy in trial room is extremely rude and super unfriendly.|0
cashiers are slow|0
such rude staff! asked for another size and she walked off and said go ask someone else.|0
i went buy store closed due to covid-19.|0
why do they close at 9:10 pm if the business hour is 9:30 pm?|0
shope there if you re trendy and skinny|0
never went into store just passed by.|0
this store wins the medal for the worst customer service!|0
you should not be invading my privacy in this manner.|0
needed a scarf,couldn't find it. come on man!|0
loud music, bright lights, poor selection.|0
poorly customer service|0
awful!!|0
bad customer service|0
understaffed|0
terrible service|0
no minions|0
great selection compared to other locations. but the customer service is non existent. no greeting or even acknowledgement from staff. the fitting rooms are not private because you can see people in the reflection of the walls.|0
i frequently order and purchase things from h&m, particularly their home line. yet, i find this location to be a bit of a mess with abrasive employees. i went in for a return and to pick up a couple things. i initially couldn't find the item i was looking for with no employees in sight besides on cash. then when i went to make the return (only had the return label as my package was missing the slip) the cashier was quite rude and rushing me and trying to touch the app on my phone to pull up the order qr code despite me doing so quite quickly. when it came to the purchase i was making the one item was partially missing and damaged, i had found it in the sale section without an adjusted price. when i asked what it could be discounted the cashier didn't give me enough time to explain that additionally to one parting being missing, there were also damages. the manager didn't even give it the time of day and offered 15% off something that half of which was missing or damaged.|0
usually find what im looking for here but not today. not much of a sale and im finding quality for mens casual very cheap. i found better quality at old navy.|0
"i was there just this weekend and got some stuff. when at the register, the guy charged me full price for an item that was on sale. so i had to go back and get that fixed and the person at the counter did not even apologise. what's worst, i go back home and check the same thing again, they forgot to take the big security tag off the cardigan, so i had to go back again the next day. i am at the counter again with my receipt and expressing my disappointment and the guy replies ""oh well, that's too bad, isn't it"" with no hint or sign of apology. one of the worst customer service i have ever expereinced. i am not upset because they made a mistake, what upsets me is the fact how certain retail employees talk to people. if you have work in the service industry, better have the correct manners and the right attitude. and in saying that, i have worked in retail myself and never treated people like this."|0
so if something is shown as $14.99, it might not actually be $14.99. rather, something else on the same rack. this is frustrating when the real price of the trouser is $29.99.|0
the brown female manager at the eaton center ,children's section is so rude. she is the most rude manager i ever saw in my life ,and she laughs at customers with other workers,what a horrible customer service at this place i love shopping at. stay away from that hm the manager is not a kind person.|0
treated like i was invisible. cashiers would rather talk to each other while stuffing my merch in a bag i didn't want and taking my money i won't be giving in the future. selection in store was good but chaotic to navigate.|0
annoying layout if you want to find anything. i was looking for men's slim fit stretchy shorts. mens shorts were located in at least 5 different parts of the store. i gave up and left not finding what i wanted.|0
the store probably represents one of my personal nightmares. the lights are so bright, there is always load music but it's not enjoyable, and it tends to attract a very young crowd of teenage girls squealing as they throw around purchases or objects that they cannot afford.|0
the music and announcements are so loud in here it feels like they're trying to make it a club. how are you supposed to shop or talk when your brain is being melted by sound?? i honestly feel bad for the sales associates, they're probably suffering hearing damage|0
i'm a huge fan of joeys back in alberta because of their food and service (absolutely outstanding customer service at the ne calgary location). the joeys here is terrible. the same dish i order in calgary (lobster ravioli) tasted so poorly made...and the service? ....rude & quite frankly demeaning. the waitress got my friend's order wrong (gave her a chicken pasta instead of veggie pasta), and instead of apologizing, she made it seem like it was my friend's fault and brought the manager over. he asked why she couldn't *just* eat the chicken! will never go back there again, and making sure to tell everyone about my experience.|0
the music is so loud in this store that i felt stressed. they have good prices and nice staff though.|0
nothing much appealing, bright lighting loud music, crowded, noisy, not enough room to move, verry hot warm sweaty smells around...|0
low quality products...color fades after washing. some pants tearing after a couple of times in the laundry|0
pricey item and not that quality|0
the quality of clothes is bad but it's a cheap store.|0
can never find wanted items in stock.|0
not happy with the ambience in the store|0
sales rep were no where to be found ...|0
it's not for me|0
very low quality clothing|0
not enough staff|0
crowded and strange.|0
no chair for companions ... i'm going out|0
"i purchased a men's belt on july 3,2022 at this store. when i approached the cash counter no greeting what's so ever. a tall young black male behind the counter cashed me out. not a word during the whole time. i told him the belt on sale on h&m website and show him the price. he cashed me out by saying no return on sale item. i asked him if possible to punch more holes on the belt he unwillingly replied ""no"". no ""hi"", no ""thank you"" nothing the whole time while i was there. may be i'm an old fashion simple thank you would long way. to me, it appears he doesn't want to be there serving customers. he need to understand there are many young people loved to have a job like he has."|0
hate this place no one helps you the store is so messy. can never find what i want. the one in hillcrest is much better|0
the store does not update their inventory ever. drove 30 minutes just to find out that every size was sold and not a single piece of item was available when it showed online that all sizes were available for that item. zero care from the workers or management.|0
i wish i could rate the customer service a 0! i wanted to exchange an item. i had a gift receipt and the store manager would not offer me an exchange or a store credit. item had tags on it, was never worn and was a christmas gift. i assured her that i was about to spend alot more and she was very rude and would not help. be prepared, if you want to return something at this store, they do not honour their store policy and the manager will give you a hard time. i will never shop at this location again. i will support other locations or buy online. this post is strictly based on my experience with the store manager. i contacted head office and i hope she is spoken to about how she speaks to her customers.|0
poorest customer service ever experienced in an h&m. the employee was extremely rude and had zero literally zero sense of his own store. never coming backk|0
it's always so nice hearing staff that work at the store talking about how dumb customers are because of simple questions being asked, definitely not okay. it was a woman with blunt black hair that worked may 31st 2022 wearing a green top at 7:16 pm near the front of the store|0
dear h&m even if you dont allow returns for selected items, at least do so if a product is defective. well what can a large company lose so you wont probably care. talk about you get what you pay for principle|0
went to vaughan mills last night waited 25 minutes to get into the mall picked out what i wanted from h&m. product i had to exchange still had tags on them and was told sorry we can't exchange it. i was baffled as i have no issues anywhere else i was returning the same top just for a smaller size. really frustrating . poor quality for customer service as not even the manager would try to come up with a solution.|0
this is the worst h&m in the gta! do not shop here. this store is run by some horrible troll karen who yells at customers when they have issues. i tried to return two spring jackets i bought within the hour. the troll lady denied the refund because they were sale items. i was neither aware nor was i told that sale items were final when i was cashing out. (very dishonest policy but that's another story) she (maybe a he?) then started shouting at me and so rudely stated that i couldn't read because the return policy is on the receipt. when i responded she charged at me and then threatened to call security on me (lowkey a racial attack because i'm a black male re: central park karen lady) i'm so disgusted. i will never shop at h&m again.|0
went into the vaughanmills location on july 28th around 630pm to shop and was treated with such rude and unapproachable manner by seems to be mod on duty ..she was petite asian and when i approached her to ask return policy for sale items and where the cash counter was..she rolled her eyes and pointed at cash as i was inconveniencing her. imagine the rest of the team must be treating other customers if the manager on duty was acting in such manner. i will not be returning tp thi location. totally unprofessional manner. i will go to that location again.|0
don't shop at h&m. tried to exchange an xmas gift for my child. i had the pants in my hand the return and the exact same pants just 2 sizes larger. they refused to do the exchange. so arrogant and rude. we don't do exchanges without receipts. same pants just larger and you say no. what is this world coming to. this company will definitely be out of business soon.|0
messy store. unhelpful workers. asked one a question he completely ignored me and i asked again and he ignored me for a call on his radio intercom. ended up not buying anything because 3 different employees walked into me and pushed passed me. rather then waiting the 5 secs for me to get where i'm going.|0
this h&m is simply terrible in customer service. the employees are unprofessional in past couple of times i visited. even the managers are rude with lack of knowledge about their own promotions. i visited other h&m and never had any problems but here in vaughan mills, every single time they drive me crazy. could you please teach your employees and manager in this branch how to respect customers and teach them about h&m promotions and policies. i know h&m policies better than the managers that i had to show them the print out even once. so disgusting and disappointing! never ever gonna shop in this branch.|0
this is the worst h&m i have been to in my entire life. i have lived in sweden for many years and know how h&m operates. i go to the one in eaton centre and bloor, those are my local ones, the stuff is great and know how to keep their stores clean. but this time, we decided to go there thanks to the lego discovery centre. i had a terrible accident in there due to their negligence, and still nursing my injury 3 weeks later. they had no 1st aid kit, they were terrible with first aid, as a family we had to diy the 1st aid. they took our details and said they were gonna check on me that very week. never happened! i am still waiting, but 3 weeks later, come on.|0
horrible service. staff is extremely rude. i just got surgery and ask to have some stuff held at the front so i couldn't carry is. they lost all the stuff i put in the front within a matter of 5 min. i had to go recollect what i could injured. then she gave me back over $50 in 10s when there was bigger bills in the till and i asked for them.|0
i attempted to return a single item without a receipt at this store last weekend. they gave me a number to call customer service and c. service didn't do anything for me; useless. the manager at this store came off as extremely arrogant and rude. i'm not coming back here.|0
this h&m provides unbelievably disgusting customer service. h&m itself is one of the best fashion retails and always has the best prices and qualities but staff here are extremely rude! if you think you call a manager and attitudes are going to change?! wrong! managers are the same...they are working there to ruin your shopping experience. if you call for help, they gonna ignore you...if you complain about that, they gonna blame you!!!!!! if you call this store for a check, no answer! if you want to pay for ur items, don't expect any kind of greeting at cash. try to go to yorkdale or hillcrest mall! they provide good service|0
for the life of me i can't stand any of the employees at this location they are so rude, unhelpful, disrespectful and full of attitude. h&m as a company is appreciated because of their selection of clothing and return policy... but please please please, hire better staff.|0
at no point did anyone approach to help! we left... not good.|0
a male manager yesterday i had an issue and he was called to cash he didnt deal with the situation appropriately very rude and not listening to none of concerns and walked off and didnt resolve the issue .this h&m management team is very poor do not recommend shopping in here very mess in the store|0
really rude, unprofessional staffs.|0
in this location, staff need to have more training to provide better customer service!! employees are unprofessional! customer service is much better in yorkdale mall.|0
terribly long lines. barely staffed checkouts|0
love the company- shop there often. poor customer service very rude and unprofessional never satisfied when purchasing items.|0
cashier that deal with me didn't want me to use my discount and came up with stupid excuse. very disappointed|0
zero customer service.|0
the white cashier with glasses, screwed up my checkout and forgot to take off the security tag of my tee. smh|0
never been here but google says i was|0
zero customer service dont bother to ask anything they will not help you!!|0
very rud and impolite staffs specially the managers|0
parking is scarce, traffic in the vicinity is insane, the mall is too big to shop effecitvely. yawn mills.|0
worst store. doesn't treat people like humans. don't work here.|0
the staff rudely disconnects when you call the store. no courtesy. no customer service.|0
poorest customer service ever , employee doesn't know how to talk to customer|0
worst quality of clothes.i will not buy it again|0
worst customer service and employee are been so rude towards customers.|0
low quality....stay away|0
lazy and rude|0
never been there|0
browsed around the store last thursday morning. it seemed like everyone was working at a snails pace except for two staff members (the girl in the fitting room + a young man at the men's pay/checkout area). everyone else clearly needed some coffee. store seemed tidy, wide selection of items to choose from but not the best customer service. i suggest shopping at another h&m location, or online|0
no mirrors placed anywhere in the store. - a very elaborate strategy by management to make people go to the fitting rooms if they need a mirror.|0
i bought a scarf set with glove and tam i didn't notice one of the gloves was missing until i got home. i live way to far to go back for it so it's just a lost for me i mean i can still rock the scarf and tam but i had to use an old black glove i had to wear with my new one glove problem solved i guess but h&m needs to make sure their items are fully stock with all that comes with it. other than that nice clothes.|0
i loved the place a couple years ago but something changed, no it wasn't the prices or the service. something just felt off as if something or someone was missing, i can't very well put my finger on it.. but i definitely miss whatever it was. i will admit some of the sales associates are amazing and they provide great service! even when it gets busy the employees definitely know how to work under pressure delivering great customer service, at a very efficient rate! & they got rid of divided grey for men..|0
to much expensive but less quantity. can't find good quality wearing|0
not really the tidiest of h&m you might find around. the cloths are all mixed up and is really difficult to find a particular type. being in vaughan mills makes it more crowded. visit an h&m at a nearby mall near you and you can find what you are looking for much easily.|0
stood at cashier while two employees walked right past me. a third employee came and said cash was closed. how about a sign? how about acknowledging a customer and saying this cash is closed but someone can help you at another cash. i left without buying..|0
nothing special, only one of the hundreds of h&m locations. used to have good deals as it's in an outlet mall but those good old days are gone...|0
it's cheap retail i get it, but at least take the security tags off my clothes i bought .|0
no good sales and choices for boys clothing. nevertheless, customer service was very good.|0
hated it. some good stores but the people that go here. omg|0
they downsized their area of kids fashion, probably due to covid|0
customers need to take pride and not throw the merchandise on the floor.|0
not cheap better online|0
after covid, poor choices|0
don't like the stuff.|0
terrible washrooms|0
i realized why i never shop from this brand again. i pass by because i need urgently to buy simple t-shirt. i've been waiting on the line for 20 minutes although there is no one in front of me because they're lack of stuff. well i lost 30 mins and my mood. pay 5$ more go to another store|0
nice store however their changing room policy is ridiculous. i waited in line which was quite long, but understandable it's the weekend. there is a 7 item limit and i had 12. i split them in half to stay within the limit. however when i wanted to try the second half of my outfits i was told that i need to redo the line. it's a first time i ever hear that in a store. i already waited in line and only needed a few more minutes to try the rest of my clothes. overall it ruined the visit because i wasn't able to try the rest of my items|0
some cashiers are really unprofessional and horrible at dealing with costumers unfortunately. being polite is free btw!|0
goggle said the store closes at 6pm and so does the sign at the door. i got there at 5:33pm and they locked the doors already!|0
awful experience with the store employees, absolutely nonprofessional, lack customer service etiquettes. a store employee started chasing my family right from the time we entered the kids area. she would come and instruct us not to do this or that and later misguided about the changing room. i argued about her behavior ansmd she called her supervisor and this guy was worse than her. he asked me to arrange the clothes that we tried which was against the customer service rules. both the supervisor and the employee made sure that i don't come to h&m again. i wrote a complain but no reesponse yet. i would recommend h&m to teach ethics to your employees.|0
the people working at this store are insufferable. spend your money and time elsewhere!|0
nice store, awful service. tried to exchange my 5yr old granddaughter's shoes i bought the day before which had a manufacturing defect. (the inside sole in the left shoe was bend and glued in half creating a bump which wasn't visible when i bought it.) when the two girls at service desk refused the exchange i asked for the supervisor (refused to identify herself) who told me that the shoes didn't look brand new. the next day i went to h&m rockland branch where everything was settled in 5 minutes.|0
long time customer who quit the store for good. customer services will straight lie to you saying they can't get back your receipt. was just trying to exchange an item for a different size.|0
i had the worst experience of shopping in this store of h&m yesterday. i forgot my mask and just covered my face, then went to the cashier to ask if they can give me a mask, they told me no. then i went towards the exit door, looking at items, while i was still covering my face, i saw the cashier came to me and literally throw me out of the store in a very disrespectful way. his behaviour to me was super offensive and really disrespectful. the point is that mask obligation will be removed from the next week in quebec and it has been removed last month in ontario. i will not comeback to this store again.|0
"would give a 0 if possible, nothing wrong with the store or the merchandise but what a rude staff! manager decided to close down the fitting rooms one day before christmas to ""protect"" his staff while rest of shop was heaving with shoppers, anyway, manager is the most disrespectful and hate filled human being i had to lay my eyes on. but he didn't ruin christmas for me man! love conquers all!"|0
rediculous behaviour and unkind staff, i wanted to acompany my mom in fitting room just a moment to see how the dress fits, they didnt let me , what is this rule, why you need such a rule in fitting room, it was just for a moment???!!!!|0
i usually love h&m and the people who work there, but this one girl made it a nightmare. she wears circular glasses and has wavy hair. her coworker referred to her as camilla or something close. i don't believe fits the h&m image she was terribly, and i mean extremely, nasty to customers. i can tell she feel superior|0
the employee wasn't aware of the brand's policies and decided to gaslighted me instead, not a fun experience and left empty handed instead|0
when i wanted to go in for a quick browse, the guy at the door stopped me and stated that their policy is to not let anyone in 20 min before the closing time.they should really change the closing time if that is the case.|0
worst h&m i have seen. employees and the manager's are very rude. it's seems like they don't like there job, it's sad too see that in customer service.|0
please check your checkout bag before leaving as the cashiers are a bit incompetent of bagging all your products. once you face a problem with h&m do not expect customers service.|0
the staffs were really rude. they behaved with me like they are my boss and even yelled at me from behind. it really shocked me. it's such the worst experience that i have ever had when go shopping! i strongly recommend that the manager here should consider their staff, teach them how to behave politely with customer like what they promised in their interview!|0
haven't been to any of these in years, but was curious about shirts. many of them are displayed all wrinkled and some stuff seems dusty. the staff seems to get ruder with the years. we shouldn't expect much at these stores though|0
let me preface this by saying that i like h&m but wow this store was something else (and not in a good way). i mean it was the day after black friday but this was not a good experience, the store was way too crowded and stock was severely limited. the queue for the changing rooms was incredibly long and so very slow. after trying on the clothes i was considering purchasing i put the ones onto the tried-on clothes rack. or so i thought. oh how very wrong i was! i was verbally assaulted by one of the workers about how i had put my clothes in the only place that seemed appropriate but, as it turned out, wasn't quite the right spot. oh my gosh, this sass that she gave me was wholly inappropriate and ruined the store for me. everyone else i dealt with at the store was delightful but this worker was terrible. maybe it was just because it was busy but it was definitely not the correct response to a complete non-issue.|0
rude hostile cashier. awful customer service. not to mention some locations have closed fitting rooms so you have to purchase items and try them at home. the process of buying from h&m is hideous and time consuming.|0
i'm never going to that store ever again . i'm 27 weeks pregnant. i politely and respectfully asked the security guard at the door if i had to wait in the line outside before i could get in ( due the current covid situation ) like everyone else or if had any priority . he said you have no priority and you wait like everybody else ! the was very rude and insensitive and could have said it nicely in a different way . i'm very disgusted by how disrespectful and rude de was|0
"very rude employees. i was waiting for my son today outside the fitting rooms. the shop was crowded and the wait was very long. i am not a young person and suffer from a medical condition so i needed to sit. found a bench where a young man was already sitting so i sat next to him. a pissed employee came to me and told me that it's not allowed to sit here. i stood up, said that i was waiting for my son who was in the fitting room and asked him if there was a place where i could sit; he answered in the rudest way: ""this is not a coffee shop and we don't have places for people to sit"". is this how you treat your customers? talking to them rudely and not even providing a chair where someone would sit? decent stores always provide chairs especially near the fitting rooms. and most importantly they teach their employees how to be polite with customers."|0
the staff was nice...but the call center was mega rude and unhelpful. i asked to have someone call the store to see if the pants i had bought too big since now you can't try stuff on...where available in a size smaller and to put them aside...they flat out refused and told me it was because of covid...but 2 hours before the call center guy had done just that. what a terrible customer service|0
the employee was super rude to me, for checking a jacket. he came at me and start yelling at me that i cannot touch the jackets and he will take it... of course he asked me if i wanted to buy all the items i was holding with my other hand. i really don't know what is going on in terms of training in this store.|0
this store has 3 floors and doesn't even have maternity clothes. you have to order them online.|0
the worst....staff is so rude...if h&m is going to continue like this then i dont think so that it will sustain for long. i have nevr seen a company with such bad customer service... i will nevr buy from hnm again thanks to their rude staff.... save some bucks and buy from zara instead...zara is worth it.|0
"went there to return an item. the cashier wasn't friendly, didn't say anything (except ""hi"", oh and where's the ""bonjour?"" he said to all previous customers?) nor smiled. didn't wish me a great day at the end of transaction. he only managed to say a ""thanks"" that i could barely hear after i said ""merci, bonne journee"". wow this must be the worst customer service i've ever encountered. ps: pls note that the fact that i'm asian doesn't mean i can't speak french :)"|0
i was told by the manager that my outfit was inappropriate to shop at the store! and they asked me not to be around kids in the store! so rude!|0
worst customer experience of my life + barely any sizes over 2|0
so much stuff i get claustrophobic. quality is garbage, dyes used on garments are probably toxic for your skin and weird plastic smell (forsure toxic as well). bye|0
please update your working hours if you no longer let people in, 20 min before closing time. i experienced this on june 2nd, 2020 06:38 pm|0
store says it closes at 7 on sunday, made the long walk there to find out it closes at 6 and i wanted to try on a dress but a guy who works there was so rude and kept pushing me out of the store saying it was closed|0
poor quality. shop has a very small choice of clothes.|0
i asked to borrow a hanger, a hanger, and they said no! swriously, one plastic hanger and kevin and his not helpful tattoos lisped no. seriously, nevver ask to borrow disposible plastic hanger.|0
bought a sweater there was a hole in it two weeks later also they had incorrect advertising|0
worst costumer service ever|0
was literally told by a staff member that i was too fat to shop in a store like this. yeah thanks for the self-esteem boost.|0
worst security, manner less, don't care about customers, really aggressive.|0
the lady on the cash counter was extremely rude. worst experience.|0
i try to return what i buried, but they not take it|0
passport vaccinal is necessary for entry|0
the staffs were really rude, and very bad customer service!!!|0
awful experience! cheap clothes! cheap services!|0
cheap fast fashion shop.|0
bad customer service i've ever seen|0
nawww|0
poor service|0
the cashier is horrible at dealing with costumers|0
extremely poorly organized store, we waited 20 minutes to checkout because the employees were not able to do their job quickly and did everything but pass as many customers as possible. in addition, towards the end of our wait an employee told the people behind us to go to another checkout and therefore passed in front of us. i do not recommend this branch at all!|0
super smart to close the men's fitting rooms and overload those upstairs, another big gathering of nobel prize winners|0
online purchase with delivery never made by swoopin. catastrophic logistics. no call, no email, impossible to reach swoopin who received and returned the items to h&m. in terms of sustainable development, it is distressing. in short, i found other negative comments on deliveries and swoopin. i confirm. do not buy online!|0
completely ridiculous! stupid and arrogant employees who refuse that i go see my boyfriend in front of his cabin for 2 seconds to help him in his choices! also refuse that i bring/give him a new size and they only speak to you in english. i understand that they are not the ones who dictate the rules but there is clearly a respectful way to say it! but i also add to whom it may concern that these are ridiculous rules.|0
rude service... the girls in the cabins are really not nice. plus, i've already been (twice) asked to have my tote bag checked (plus a garage bag with stuff i just bought from the other shop). the security didn't even apologize to me despite the fact that he took all my stuff out of my tote bag (also my bra in front of all the other customers). the alarm didn't even go off, which he scrutinized my stuff because i look racialized.|0
brothel store, i go to see a saleswoman to ask where the plus size department is (given the size of the store i thought there was one) she was very cold, not at all friendly and told me that there are none that you have to shop online... ok super nice not to think about large sizes in stores we are 2022 thin then!!!!|0
checkout error, and cashier who doesn't even apologize despite asking for verification before paying / very bad service she had the face of a rude person, please choose your cashiers carefully because it affects service at the store, i will never go back to this outlet|0
- rude workers at the gate during peak business hours - employee who prevents me from seeing my wife try on clothes in the cabins: call security?!! - unilingual english-speaking service at the checkout - forces me to go up myself to take the same garment 2 floors above because the price was not on the one chosen all this happened in a single visit of 10min, wow!!!|0
the cashiers are just talking. there is a line up of more than 50 people and nothing is progressing!!!! i don't recommend you at all. a very big lack of professionalism in addition she is stupid like their foot|0
horrible experience. store 3 floors, only one open fitting room, 30 min wait to try on clothes. endless wait at the checkout too, slow and inefficient employees|0
nothing.. no service, already it's h&m and moreover the employees despise you.. well|0
i love h&m, but this store is not my favorite scandinavian brand. the selection of clothes is really limited it's like in a sweatshop and even if you find something the fitting rooms are never open it's scandalous.|0
"no stars. no notice that the fitting rooms close at 7:30 p.m. there are a lot of employees and they have fun chatting rudely with their microphones and we hear very well their comments of ""get out"" when there are 30mins left before closing time. big lack of management in this particular store ."|0
employees at the arrogant children's cabins, who don't want to work at all: order online you will feel much better!!!|0
hello light pollution? - it's a bit intense|0
customer service really sucks once i went to buy i tried on a jacket that was on sale, the saleswoman spoke to me in anger and she was shouting at me and moreover things on sale you cannot try on and even when you buy them there is no return! but it's crazy and moreover i went another time to buy sandals i saw them online.. there were none in store.. i asked nicely that i make the order at the checkout like at zara.. she answered me oddly the cashier .. i told her i do not want home delivery because there are neighbors who steal things, she told me it's none of my business! while the sandals if i buy them online it costs 34 dollars with delivery of 8 dollars!! plus tax the sandals became 50 dollars!! what a scam! and there was a saleswoman, she was yelling at a veiled woman because she was mistaken when she went upstairs!! i prefer that you hire people who give good customer service and i don't know why delivery costs 8 dollars while zara costs 5 dollars|0
very disappointed with your customer service. i buy 3 pairs of tights. i take the size large on the advice of a saleswoman who tells me that i can exchange the boxes that are still sealed anyway. i open and use a pair that is a little too big. so i go back to the store to exchange my 2 new boxes for mediums. and the saleswoman refuses because the policy is no return for pantyhose, even with boxes that have never been opened. i feel ripped off and i don't want to shop with you anymore.|0
"i wanted to buy an outfit for 50$ and the only correct size available was on the mannequin, i asked the manager ""dara"" if he could remove it from the mannequin so that i could buy it and he told me that he had no right. i've never heard of her in my life in a linen store. in my opinion he didn't want to since it was closing time."|0
before 15 minutes that the store closes an employee kindly tells me that i should go down. i said okay! during this time i was choosing a necklace, after not even 30 seconds another employee comes to me and says excuse me but we are closed can you go down to pay i told him you will close in 15 minutes, right? she answers me with latitude no we are closed and you should go down because we are closing now. but seriously it's really rude.|0
i know it's not easy being a saleswoman in a department store, but that doesn't prevent being polite. a total lack of cordiality i find it despicable to give away (or rather throw away) the bag as one would throw away a trash can (perhaps the french accent bothers him, because the previous client (quebecer) was treated coldly but correct).|0
i am not talking here about the products or the goods, but good staff, arrogant and very disrespectful, really to avoid!!!|0
the place is getting colder and colder. since the renovations, customers have lost sight of the exterior to let them focus on the models in the collection. this gives an anxiety-provoking atmosphere. the collection is still small. and the choice of products has been further reduced. too bad the little charm that the place had has disappeared.|0
i had the problem concerning the authorization of credit card, since my bank sent me a convocation, in which mentions this store which had asked two times on one purchase, i know that it happens a few times, so i went there the next day to check what happened, so the waitress was not at all patient and told me that she could not check the receipt i had signed at that time that, which is unbearable it is it gave me the impression that my question on the payment and the authorization of credit irritates him. in short, it's a shop, a brand of cheap clothing, like father such son, customer service is also cheap! we can not expect too much otherwise it's your fault, huh?|0
rotten customer service. if you are sadomasochists, go there you will be served! you have to come up with the attitude to put those salespeople back in place.|0
demasiado costoso too expensive|0
worst cashier i've come across in my life. endless waiting in the fitting rooms, but it's always the same.|0
it's a huge bazaar. lots of stock of poor quality clothes, with no storage logic, it's very hard to find anything.|0
sell boxers so tight you can be sure to become sterile in record time. non-refundable|0
apparently plus sizes can't find clothes in h&m stores. why ?|0
very unpleasant sellers, a long queue for the cabins and a bit of a mess everywhere|0
still unable to try. only trade for sales...|0
siempre me ha gustado esta tienda pero aqui esta saturada, no se ver nada sin recibir empujones i have always liked this store but here it is saturated, you can't see anything without being pushed|0
rude employees|0
bad customer service|0
it's simple i love h&m|0
exchange system that dates back to the 1950s.|0
shop to visit|0
iiiiiii|0
great in-store selection and nice staff. didn't appreciate not being allowed to try clothes on because the store policy doesn't want customers trying on clothes an hour before they close... it was 7:55 and was told the store wants everyone out by 8:45 pm. i'm from out-of-town, very inconvenient, so i left a slew of items behind (potential revenue).|0
all 3 changing rooms were closed, disappointing. i guess they do it at a certain time but still, could be handled better.. they had a sign in the men's saying to go to 1st and 2nd floor and those were closed also.|0
"i think some of there employees might be in need of client service lessons, and this is why: i went to the h&m today at 8:15 pm and when i gut there i tried to ask the help of this guy and he just snubbed me, i thought he might be busy so i asked the help of a lady that was working on the jeans section. honestly, she was friendly, helpful and professional. however couple of the pieces that i picked up didn't fit. so i asked her for help again unfortunately, it was 8:45 and she have shelfs to arrange. so she referred me to another employee (which was the same guy from earlier) ,and i went with him but he was very rude and suddenly he start dropping words like (we have nothing for you) and (try h&m online ""implying that i am annoying his lordship"") and when i told him where i could find another stores he looked at me up and down and annoyingly direct me to couple other stores. i returned back the stuff i was planing to buy as i am not about paying money for insults and left the store wandering how the hell this guy was allowed to talk to clients. i mean honestly, that guy attitude was so rude i thought i might own him money or maybe he will give me these clothes out of the kindness of his heart. i think h&m must watch some of there employees attitudes."|0
fast fashion front runner. cheap materials at semi cheap prices. really bad for environment since these will not last and end up in garbage.|0
staff needs more experience in costumer service. not perfessional & not very helpful. i left 6 articles in store & won't be going to that location anymore|0
poor customer service. i will never shopping there again. not too many selections.|0
"the staff here doesn't know anything about return policy of online order. they will tell you ""vente finale"" when you try to return online order."|0
there is a $6 differences between scarfs in the womens section and mens section. they are of the same size and seemingly made of the same material. this made me sad|0
i went during the holidays, they closed the store before the closing time and the security guard was being very rude about it.|0
the st. catherine store is so obnoxiously bright. it is literally an eyesore. i cant stand passing by at night, its that bad.|0
35 minutes to try on clothes is unreasonable.|0
changing rooms are closed so it's impossible to try anything on|0
stocks online and over the phone are not accurate|0
synthetic fabrics made by children sold by late teens. only works in a pinch.|0
they left the security tags on my clothes =/|0
not much variety, inspite of prime location|0
black friday sales were pathetic.|0
good place|0
coolest monkey in the jungle|0
ok|0
heavily expensive|0
wrong prices|0
too crowded|0
good variety, horrible personals|0
the few sellers available are not pleasant and no fitting rooms?? also, no men's shirts??|0
there are no more jeans shorts or shorts that make sense from a little stretch. there are sizes xxs or xxl but nothing in between. i want to point out that it's 40 outside right now...|0
untidy store and unwelcoming staff|0
very few choices for men.|0
tidy, few people during covid. on the other hand, i would have preferred to know that we cannot try on the clothes before moving downtown. in the end, i went shopping elsewhere. never mind.|0
for real between this h & m and pekin in the rush hour i can't make the diff|0
no es posible que en uno de los lugares mas frios del mundo, no vendan orejeras! it is not possible that in one of the coldest places in the world, they do not sell earmuffs!|0
no choice of gloves - too bad that's what i was looking for|0
question of luck it's the same items that are repeated. same style.|0
varied and affordable merchandise. execrable service.|0
too expensive for nothing|0
unique men's area and in the basement.|0
poor quality and durability of clothing|0
poor service. a mess!|0
corona! crown!|0
beautiful clothes but only poorly educated young sellers (men's section) fitting room closed (why?)|0
ah so disappointed. i ordered online, package came late and i was already on the trip. just got back, tried everything and its too baggy, so i brought it to the store for a store credit as it was a little passed 30 days. they have all items in stock right now so i did not see a problem. counter attendant was super nice but her manager was not, after checking that items are not used they tried to scan to return it but smh did not work and manager said that items cannot be returned, then i ask to exchange and its a no. i buy h&m very often especially for my kids but now i will choose zara or gap which are the same quality brands providing excellent customer service!!!|0
i spoke to a lady on the kids section before i bought an item and she told me that i could return or exchange item that i'm buying for my daughter. when it turns out that the pants i bought was too small for my daughter i tried to return it to the store. without hearing me out or listening to my story, the clerk just said sorry its final sale. you can't return it. there you go. without any compassion. could it be that your staff made a mistake or miscommunicated?! as a brown person dressed in street clothes i felt like i was being judged when i walked in there. i honestly don't care about the money but i felt that it could have been handled a lot better . better take your business elsewhere.|0
very poor customer service, i was trying scarf while my sister was paying, one worker told me you can't take scarf front of mirror, i don't know if i dont try how can i buy , it was rude i never seen someone said you can't take there|0
horrible experience at this store. was demeaned and insulted by a staff member while trying on clothing. after contacting their customer service department about the incident, they promised some sort of credit, only to ghost me and ignore further emails. guess this is acceptable to them. i have shopped here for years but will never go back again.|0
"bad customer service!!! i am really disappointed with the service i've got from h&m today. i am a royalty member of h&m. today i wanted to return one item of hundreds items that i bought online from h&m at this place( pacific centre) but since it was just few days past from 30 days they didn't accept the return. i was thinking with my self that how much i have spent during last past years and how awful customer service i got. i asked the manager to just do the return this time for me since i wasn't able to return the item which was completely unused from the summer collection and he repeated the policy for me and asked me to call h&m customer service and get the authorization. after spending an hour in that branch and trying to contact ""customer service"" their answer was the same. i am really upset at this time because i have never seen this kind of cs in vancouver before. never come back to h&m again!"|0
not enough cashier's, cashier's do not listen to customers and added unnecessary charges.|0
i bought two pair of shorts. two weeks later, the zipper failed on one. when i tried to return that pair, the manager said, no receipt, no exchange. shoddy products, lousy return policy, lousy customer service. never again.|0
it's not worth the score.the customer service is so bad.the staff didn't understand the guidelines and contents of the service, so they spent half an hour, but they couldn't find a good reason. a place where someone who she like to be a manager speaks cant english|0
the cashier over there are so rude. they do not know anything about costumer service. i went there yesterday and the price was written wrong at one place abd the system was showing different price. when i noticed it, the cashier started arguing with me. i am a nice person and it was my worst experience. i would never visit at this location again.|0
do not shop at this store. the staff is the most unhelpful of all stores. h&m is already weak when it comes to customers service and quality but this store managed to be the worst one.|0
employee rushed me out of the change room bad service|0
really bad customer service. right at 06:59, we wanted to exit the store. the girl at men's department was closing the shutter gate. we requested if she could open the gate, she straight up refused to open it and told us that we need to exit through granville st. we then hurried up to female section upstairs.this girl up there was closing the door. we requested if she could open the door. she didn't say a word after this. my boyfriend apologized to her twice but she said nothing at all. at last, we said thankyou and she didn't even respond to that. the worst associate i have ever met in my life. maybe the employees need to be a little nicer towards customers.|0
apparently returns aren't allowed friday through sunday which is a nuisance considering their dressing rooms are closed. how as a business can you select days when returns are and aren't permitted not only is this super inconvenient it's incredibly bold considering your located in a monday to friday business environment of business towers. do better|0
they won't let you return things in store that were purchased online, which is a pretty irritating and cheap company policy. definitely not clear when making a purchase in their website. i don't normally shop at h&m and this definitely won't motivate me to do so.|0
several days ago i purchased a shirt. i was getting ready to go to work and put my new shirt on. what a surprise! the security tag was still on. oh well, i thought happens, human error. i just went to the store to take it off, so after mere apologies i asked for a discount for the next purchase, as i had to use my time and money to get back to the store. unfortunately we don't do it here, i heard from the girl at the cash register. she talked to the manager and he confirmed. i returned the shirt, i won't support this company ever again, there lots other options.|0
worst service ever!! i like h&m and their clothing gives you a good bang for your buck. this location is the absolute worst though and i wouldn't recommend shopping here. multiple staff members were rude and unhelpful. the store is extremely disorganized and there are clothes everywhere. it seems like a lot of stuff but none of them know what they're doing. i realize that it's covid and that certain stores aren't allowing people to try on items, it would be helpful if they had signage at the front of the store that let their customers know that. instead i ended up walking around with a huge bundle of clothes only to be told that change rooms are unavailable. the staff member i spoke to was rude about it. to make matters worse, i went back the next day to do some returns after i had gone home and tried everything on. the staff were again rude and unhelpful with the returns. i couldn't believe the horrible service that i had here. once again would not recommend shopping at this location. you're better off ordering online, you can't try on there anyways.|0
hi, dear management, just to let you know h n m pacific location has the almost worst staff. their knowledge is far far far away from practical situations. as i m a regular customer of h n m but it doesn't matter to anyone then i will be doing no shopping from hn m . thank you for making my day bad. honestly, i want to give zero star to the pacific location in terms of customer service n to the manager.|0
"pathetic customer service, specially a lady named ""anne"" on the front-desk. they behave so rude and talks like it's their own store. sales person like this are actually spoiling the brand name. sorry to say, but will never visit this store again (nor i recommend)."|0
this indian cashier was so rude and impatient with every single word i said..like if u don't wanna work as a cashier then go find another job. stop giving attitudes toward customers|0
terrible experience!!!! the cashier, she was so mean!i unfortunately i have to say it was my second and the last one i would never ever shop there. i personally work at retail for 10 years, eye contact, greeting it's the most important key at retail.|0
worst return policies. if something is torn, not even bother to exchange or return even if customer is trying to do in within 24 hours. thank you for a horrible experience regards, h n m loyal customer.|0
the male cashier was quite rude and completely unprofessional. my mother requested to get the price for a sweater because she was purchasing a size medium and all the small sizes were tagged as sale items. the cashier would not let her speak and he kept interrupting her stating that there is no sale on the item instead of simply scanning it to get the actual price. the manager i spoke to apologized repeatedly but didn't resolve the price mystery. we had to take matters into our own hands and go to a different cashier and let him scan the item only to find out the damn sweater was on sale. i will not be returning to this store due to lack of service. i don't expect extraordinary service but at least treat your customers like people! terrible service and terrible management!|0
"was looking for jeans this evening. asked the lady if she could help me with jeans. she didn't even make eye contact and said, ""i'm busy doing something else right now, but i'll be back!."" goes to women's section to hang some clothes, comes back and walks by me completely ignoring me. zero customer service! can't wait for uniqlo to open its stores! had a great experience at their location overseas. superior products too! shopping at local hollister store has been very pleasant!"|0
the cashiers are very bad. one cashier was out of receipt paper, she kept us waiting for 10 mins while she helped other customers from behind on a different register. very very bad unpleasant experience. would not recommend this store. no doubt they are going out of business. update 1: then 20 mins later. still no receipt. cashier does not know how to print the receipt or cancel the transaction. still waiting at the cash register for someone to help. feels like i am trapped here. they can't print the receipt or cancel the transaction. pathetic! update 2: after 10 more mins, the cashier disappeared and we are still waiting like objects which don't exist.|0
bought a dress shirt in seattle which was sold to me without the tag, i was assured it was fine and i'd be okay to return it if needed. i came by this location today to return the shirt because it gets very easily wrinkly in the bag despite being 'easy-iron'. they refused to return the item because there was no tag on it, even though i was told this would not be an issue... manager said since she cannot resell, she will not refund. this is unacceptable and i plan on escalating it. needless to say i will not shop here again...|0
very mad! i came all the way to shop at h&m on my night off, spent an hour meticulously looking every item through every section, looking for my size for each of the many items i wanted to try on. at the fitting room i took 7 in and they told me they'd old on to the rest (about 12 items left) and when i came out to try the rest it was all gone! i didn't even get to try on half of what i had meticulously picked out and looked for my size, face in the racks to reach (i'm short...) .... instead of the relaxing evening i had planned shopping, i came out of there completely mad , the girls working the cabins barely apologized... at least if they had showed me how sorry they are , i would have felt taking cared of as a customer... but they just stared at me blankly ... thanks for ruining my shopping evening...|0
went into this store to exchange/refund a garment that i had bought a few weeks back, but wasn't able to due to by own negligence of losing the receipt. i don't have the lady's name that was at the counter but she must be a manager or supervisor, . after my quite passive aggressive encounter with her about my garment, another (male) h&m employee came up to the counter to ask her to search a garment for a lady he was helping, to see if it was in stock in another size. she said that she wasn't able to do that as they don't have the ability to do that on their system (which i believe is not true) and told the lady to download their new app to check the store inventory on her phone. now i'm all for apps and new technology but this was a lady who was probably in her late 50s and she didn't want to download the app - fair enough, i'm in my early 30s and i wouldn't want to stand around downloading an app either. the young male employee that was helping this lady suggested that he could use the app on his smart phone to check - yay a solution! but no, the woman who had been passive aggressive with me, told him under no circumstances was he to have his phone on the floor and to put his phone away. she then told the woman to head downstairs as the system down there could check the store inventory (huh?!?!) i would just like to say well done to the young male employee who took out his phone to help the lady, it's not like we're living 20 years ago - everyone has their phones on them at all times now h&m, as long as your employees aren't stood around on the floor instagramming and taking selfies i really think they should be using their personal devices to assist with shoppers questions. i shop here quite a bit - but i will definitely chose to go to another checkout should this woman be on the desk in future!|0
the renovations is taking a long time. it has been over 1 year. no escalator, forced to use stairs. store is a mess with reduced selection. why don't they just close the store and finish renovations quickly, then reopen. don't make people shop in a construction mess.|0
"i would like to warn anyone who intends on trying anything on at this location. not only do they talk about how they hate their jobs and ""running for sizes"", they are unfriendly to customers giving them shorts answers and honestly just be impolite. not to mention they constantly grab things from you when you don't want them i thought it was maybe just a one time thing, talked to the manager, but when i went back the same thing happened again. both times i have left extremely upset. and on top of that, i actually buy clothes to try them on at home in order to avoid going back into the fitting room."|0
the staff is very rude and probably the worst experience i've had in any retail store. i happen to be walking by the store and liked something so i thought i'd go in. the cashier refused to scan the item and confirm that the item was on sale. when i asked for the manager, another employee suggested that this guy was new and i should give him a break and that i was right and the item was on sale. when we got to the cash register again to buy the item the guy threw the item towards me and walked away. it just shows that these guys aren't trained for their job and probably should not be working retail. there are plenty of other people that would happily take the job and be miles better than the employees they have working right now. i would not go back to h&m again. a big no from me. also, they should probably provide their employees with name tags so i could write that guys name on here.|0
ever since they started with their renos this location has been difficult to shop in. now they've put in the escalators but there are only fitting rooms on the second floor so it makes it difficult to get sizes, etc. or to carry more than a few things up. i was there this last thursday and when i asked if someone could check if they had a size the associate rolled her eyes at me. when i got out of the fitting room, i found out that the items that i had put aside with the same girl (that i had picked out as a gift for someone else and was not trying on), had been put back. i didn't have the energy to bother buying anything at that point and probably won't return.|0
"very disappointing costumer experience, and i have been a number one fan of h&m for years, not anymore. they have this posters saying ""buy it now, decide at home..."" and that's what i did, it was my birthday last week so i bought a bunch of stuff and decided to try at home, to see what outfit i could wear and what to keep and what not. i'm the type of person who also, always saves every little receipt, no matter how insignificant it is. weirdly somehow, they through the receipt on the bag, went home never found it again. i've been looking everywhere for my receipt so i can return one thing of the bunch of stuff that bought. i didn't like the item, how it fit, the color, the size. anyways, went there explained the situation, they said they couldn't do anything. so i was like ok so that ""buy now, decide later"" thing will not count? . no because you don't have a receipt. yes i know, i'm sorry but this is a brand new item, right out of the fabric, new collection and everything, in perfect condition, i tried it once! no no no way. so i went on the website, and i saw that yes you can return your things as long as they are in good condition, and tried to go back and showed on the screen of my phone.. and they said ""that's not in canada"". thank you h&m for making my ""buy now decide later"" decision totally on the wrong side, making me regret it. and lost a big costumer, who used to buy every single piece of clothing in h&m. never again. also, the cashie suggested that i talked to the manager, and the manager was very rude. managers are suppose to try and help you, he was cocky, cold and rude."|0
i asked a girl in the fitting room for a pair of joggers in xs in any color, and she comes back saying they don't have xs in black. i then reiterated that i would like to try on the joggers in any color that's an xs, and she snarled at me and took off. to make things worst, i went to pick up two shirts that were left with her before i went into the room, and they were nowhere to be found. it was the only sizes left in the shirts. she didn't even look for it when it was clearly her mistake for misplacing it. i couldn't believe how rude and condescending that encounter was. sorry, but i'll spend my money elsewhere now.|0
i wonder if h&m hq realizes how much money they are loosing on long fitting room and till lines. at least on three occasions i've attempted to shop here and left after standing in line for too long. your cheep cloths are not worth it.... sorry.|0
rude indian cashier.. she is talking abt me to the next cashier bcz i paid cash and join a member. so what? i paid full b!tch.|0
not great. not a lot of selections.|0
"it's busy, under construction and the worst part is that the change rooms/fitting rooms are closed off by curtains with no indication for the workers to know which rooms are empty - so the workers keep literally ""peeping"" into your room to see if it's in use. they peeked in on me at least three times while i was changing. i won't be going back to this location."|0
visited this store 10 mins ago. the white lady by the fitting room return section was extremely rude to me for no reason. never coming back.|0
they get the one star because their prices are ok. otherwise, this location would get a zero. customer service does not exist. as a customer you should feel privileged that this place exists. that's the message.|0
terrible the waitress t ried her best the pancakes and eggs everything was zzcold!! the one star is for the waitress|0
something is wrong with this store. staff look upset and tired and not willing to help customers.|0
looks boring store|0
truly disappointed! i was at the store because i had to return one item and the cashier was rude and careless!|0
very poor customer service. i have placed an order almost a month ago and i still haven't received it. very terrible service|0
the cashier is so rude. he rolled his eye at me when checking out. will never go back to this place to shop|0
went there and charged me wrong price and the called customer service to help me in this matter, they told me to go back, i live in chillwack and now have to go back to pacific center for price adjustment.|0
fast fashion.... bad quality.... but you get what you pay for, right?|0
baddest customer service especially manager in kids section|0
this place has been under construction so long i just got oil and dirt on my hands from the work.|0
not so great service|0
not fitting rooms and i have not time to back and for to returm things|0
your pop up ads are as sustainable as your underwear|0
not much selection and terrible lay out|0
they will ask you your id before you pay|0
was looking at jewellries and one of the staff rushed me to leave the area|0
she didn't take the security tag out|0
terrible customer service|0
no fitting rooms.|0
really poor customer service|0
far too expensive|0
slow the renovation.|0
poor business|0
rude staff|0
no stars if i could. i bought a friend some clothes online for her and her baby. i had it shipped to her house. she didn't recieve 1 item from the 8 things i ordered. we emailed h&m and they said to do a refund. and i didn't understand why they couldn't just ship the missing item.. so then she went to this location and was only exchanging a size and the sales associate was unprofessional, rude and disrespectful. not only that but they had made the mistake of refunding the items she wanted to exchange. not return. they refunded the items and said that there was nothing they could do about it. overall we both had terrible experiences online and in store. both situations were not our fault and they did nothing to help. along with the fact that the sales associates handled it rudely.|0
unbelievably rude stuff especially the ones working the fitting rooms. lack of proper management and organization in this store is astonishing.|0
majority of staff are extremely rude and arrogant. only one lady there seemed to enjoy her job and know what she was doing. she spoke spanish and was very friendly and accommodating. such a shame she works in a negative work environment.|0
some rude and arrogant staff. yesterday when i went, i got whacked by a door and the employee didn't even apologize, she just looked at me and walked away. also, don't come here if you support ethical labour and the quality of clothes are worse than shein's.|0
there is a girl with glasses who was extremely rude. when i asked her where i could find some clothes items, she was like 'we don't have them. go downstairs and ask someone there.', and then, when i was trying some jacket on, she came to me, and said with an annoyed face, 'you shouldn't be trying these things on cause they are on sale.', and there was no notification or sign that we cannot try sale times on. hey, if look at this review, you know, next time, try to talk more nicely to the customers cause they will understand you or i think you shouldn't be working in customer service.|0
kinda boring options. everything is green or beige. why.|0
i like to check out the different clothing and jewelery options. but everytime i step foot into the store, the customer service is terrible. staff are rude, make you wait while they are talking to other staff, no one says hi and it appears some staff don't even want to be there. i've stopped shopping there because it's a negative environment.|0
i'm not a big fan of crazy busy places, or shopping. if you don't like to shop i wouldn't recommend this place. the clothes are definitely more for millennials than someone whom is almost 40. however, if you're on a tight budget, and you like the fashion these days, i'm sure you'd like it here. oh, and they don't really cater to heavier set people very well.|0
what the heck happened to this place?! and i'm not talking about the renovations which could easily make you feel like you're in one of those escape room mazes, i'm talking about the staff and the lack of training / guidance and general giving a hoot about their job. very poorly managed dressing room because the kids working it (no one was over 20) are more interested in talking to each other or being on their phones than actually helping the people in line. there was at least five people in line and there were over 15, yes that's right fifteen, open fitting rooms. i counted. and there was for counter staff just standing around talking about music on their playlist. i was going to try and have a discussion with the manager of the store, but she was magically unavailable. (aka did not want to deal) this used to be a favourite stop and browse place for me when visiting town but not anymore thanks.|0
fun fashion. relatively good value for the dollar. lacks consistency in sizing.|0
"review based on my experience shopping men's section on two. for fast fashion shoppers, have at itinexpensive, cheap, and trendy. this downtown vancouver location can be considered a flagship. when h&m launches their annual designer collaboration this store gets the most stock and sizes. the same can be said about their minor collaborations (e.g., david beckham; the weeknd). the only lines worth considering are their studio, trend, and premium. they're made with better quality, better fabrics, and are more stylish than their regular h&m offering. from my experience, staff at this location can be rude and ignorant of what goes on. the few times i had questions i was met with ""i don't know"" and a shrug. employees keeping the store clean tend to be the rudest, for good reason: the store layout is tightly cramped and poorly merchandised. racks are overstocked, sloppy and unappealing, and the typical h&m customer contributes to the mess. in short, self-serve and expect no real service."|0
the selection of clothing was decent. i was visiting from the u.s. and have only amazing customer service in canada, with this store being the only exception to the trip. the staff was rude and dismissive to my friend and i.|0
didn't really have enough selection for men. wasn't able to find anything i liked.|0
i get followed by security everytime i go like they are actually less then 15 feet away from me its disgusting cause i spend good money there and have never taken anything even never would.|0
their clothes don't last aswell are not the best quality. good for cheap options seasonally.|0
wouldn't accept a return at all even though i never once even took the product out of the package. hugely wasteful.|0
the one in london much better this one as no punch to it same old same old they posted i could fine a kimono did not find one|0
horrible you can't try anything off their clothes..you would have to buy them to be able to try them and return them for a big or smaller size or whatever|0
tried to exchange size three times, was told more would be shipped, then told me they did not know if that would happen, called to have item in size desired put on hold, got there to pick up, wrong item presented, turns out wrong tag put on item, gave up, returned original item, very disappointed .|0
cheap clothes that you can wear it twice but once its washed, it's done.|0
yup it's a store selling cheap clothed|0
not a place i would go for bargain necessarily.|0
fauste is very unfriendly|0
it is not bad,not good|0
meh|0
bad|0
it's a great place, it's definitely budget friendly. some things are a bit more pricey. but you get good quality for the most part. the fit and finish is usually good. we love going there for fun clothes. definitely worth checking out|1
this h&m isn't huge but it's a decent size... considering there is another 3 h&m stores within a few minutes of this one. there's a reason why h&m is so successful and this store is a testament of their success. great staff, great products and even though i went in to get something small i didn't have to wait long in the queue. brilliant!|1
h&m is gradually becoming my favourite place for shopping. i know it's a chain, but i love it anyway. their coats and jackets are great, as well as the skirts and even the swimwear. nice location, clean store, friendly and helpful staff.|1
hnm is the main location for work clothes and business casual clothes. however it seems like they have less and less clothes out. there's usually only 1 maybe 2 registers open so be prepared to wait. that goes for downstairs as well. they have a huge children's section but for women good luck trying to find your size. still a great store to find clothing but its more like a needle in the haystack. i wish they never closed the downtown location. that location made sure to have a wide range of items and don't bother trying cambridge location they don't have much either.|1
i love the stores in this mall. to highlight a few, they have an ugg store, which is awesome. they are also getting a legoland in march which basically will make every child want to go shopping with their mother. the bass pro makes my husband actually okay with going shopping with me and they have a safari store that is like a huge pet store which is very fun for kids. the layout of the mall is great and it's really easy to get around for people who are disabled. my husband pulled a tendon in his leg and can't walk at the moment and they had motorized scooter so he was able to get around easily.|1
i would give it a 5 stars if there were to be a forever 21, rue 21, and justice, maybe a gucci but it's ok! and it'll be better if the mall had better restaurants, like subway (r.i.p) or cicis pizza, and a bigger and better place plays for the little ones will be cool too! love, local shopper|1
this is a very good spot. i went here with my daughters and they found a great variety on clothing and accessories. they had fun choosing some of their favorite things and getting they liked the best. good quality clothing, reasonable cost and trendy stuff. good combination. the waiting time for the fitting rooms though, was a bit long. not sure if this is because it was a friday or this is always like that. anyway, we'll be coming back. my daughters liked the experience at this place.|1
"this store is like a fashion wonderland. so many choices, all organized and displayed in a clear and uncluttered way. i went to try something on, and the attendant was so polite. he thanked me for trying stuff on (this never happens anywhere) and when i told him i was going to take some of the items, he said, ""oh great!"", like he was happy for me, lol. the other staff also seemed happy and though they were working, they were laughing together and seemed relaxed. this was really nice to see. security is in place but not overbearing or in your way. i will definitely return for more fashion inspiration at this flagship location."|1
great , i enjoy the place and this location here at pc mall. its huge it has 3 lavels. selection is good . went shopping on boxing day late afternoon thanks to gift card . h&m reminds me of a mix of old navy meets shein lol. staff are helpful and nice . it was hectic on boxing day crowds everywhere . this location does have plus size clothing up to a xxl & 18 size..... yeah it could be better selection for plus size like higher sizes and quantity but better then nothing. they have tons of xs & s sizes and anywere else in between with good verity . got a kids section . its got lots of other stuff like jewelry and phone cases, etc . tons of clothes etc for whatever the occasions and reasons of wearing . its next to public transportation this store location at this mall and central dt location too . the prices are reasonable probably the most affordable place in this entire mall for every budget|1
best store in downtown toronto located at dundas street, offering huge sale and promotions on summer collection therefore don't miss this opportunity and rush towards h&m of you are in toronto.i shopped allot ajd quality was awesome as compare to prices, all the stuff are nicely designed with beautiful color collection. it is recommended for time being as i enjoyed shopping|1
yesterday, their employee named harleen was super friendly and nice to help me find a size- in stock & on the floor, that i desperately needed. her customer service was by-far the best that i've seen (or even expected) in any h&m locations i've been to. she went above & beyond to help me out and that made my day. i really hope her management sees this because she definitely deserves a pat in the back and possibly a raise :)|1
last week, their employee named avneet was super friendly and nice to help me find a jacket size - in stock & on the floor, that i desperately needed. she went to each and every section of the store her customer service was by - far the best that i've seen (or even expected) in any h&m locations i've been to. she went above & beyond to help me out and that made my day. i really hope her management sees this because she definitely deserves a pat in the back and possibly a raise :)|1
this shop is observing social distancing beautifully. this allowed me to feel safe whilst shopping here. the store is located on regents street and has just reopened to the public. i have often walked passed this site and could not wait until they opened so i could browse around the store and see the home furnishings they sold. wow, this shop is like walking into an aladdin's cave of home furnishings. once it draws you in you found yourself being wowed by the imaginative and beautiful way they display their goods. at times i felt i was walking into a royal kitchen (almost expecting a butler is be coming around the corner to ask what we are doing in this part of the house). the store is over two floors and sells artistic but practical home items for most rooms around the house at astonishingly competitive prices. i recommend this store for people who want to give their house of flat a tasteful but original touch. out of you want to buy that special gift.|1
first time in h&m to actually shop in years, and i am very impressed with the renovations and how things are now. ultra crowded though, but there's a huge selection of merchandise. i really liked the lighting, the cleanliness of the floor, and the ability to have a conversation with the staff. change rooms were clean and private with a 7 item limit and the mirror allowed for perfect selfies. nothing negative to say about it other than it being crowded on weekends, and a bit tough to navigate with so much stuff around, but i suppose that's marketing 101 anyway.|1
the staff is always helpful - but it would help if more staff were available to help. sales are good ; quality is good too. i like h&m because they are tailored for a small fit. my son is tall and slim.|1
very beautiful interior decor with a very attractive display of items. roaming is easy inside. prices are very fair and affordable. staff are a few however so expect searching for one when you need help. it is very clean and well taken care of.|1
i love this store,it's clean and tidy things are easy to find which is just as well as when i was there the staff were very busy chatting to each other and didn't seen to want to help the shoppers! the security guard on the other hand was very helpful. there wasn't any staff in the changing rooms,it was like a jumble sale in there, very disappointed.. more staff training needed maybe!!|1
the best store ! lot of collections for men and women clothing. good customer service and the staffs are very helpful. got good deals ! its good to subscribe their promotions and buy clothes during their best deals|1
"i shopped in the regent street h&m home last night. i was a bit lost with where to find certain items i had seen online. i asked a sales associate for some help. i was looking for a certain candle which was not found in store. however, rachel advised me that she would go downstairs and check the stockroom to try and find these for me. as she was heading off the sales floor, another lady i believe to be the manager in charge asked where was she was going, rachel replied ""to find some candles for this gentlemen, the green dinner candles"" of which the manager in my opinion wasn't best pleased she was leaving the floor and simply said ""erm may be"" (kind of eye rolling) anyway, rachel found my products which were sold out online and not available on the shop-floor she gave me two of them as i requested which made me very happy. rachel also helped me to find several other items within the store that i wasn't able to. rachel also served me at the till point making sure i knew about my h&m app and even showed me where i could save 3 in vouchers that i didn't know i had towards my sale. honestly, it's not mentioned enough when you get a good service in stores people tend to just focus on the negative. rachel is a credit to that store and had she not of been there i would've walked out empty-handed. she is a breath of fresh air in a very busy retail environment but she made time for me and made me feel i was a valued customer and friend. well done rachel!! i'll be back that's for sure!!"|1
many beautiful things, with a good price and natasha was super helpful in the fitting room. definitely the best h&m customer service in london.|1
i recently visited h&m and was impressed with their selection of clothing. i found the perfect black long sleeve shirt that fits me like a glove! the fabric is high quality and the design is stylish. the store was well organized and the staff was helpful. overall, i had a great shopping experience at h&m and i highly recommend it for anyone looking for trendy and affordable clothing.|1
flagship store so it looked great. large screens playing some cool effects. store was tidy and well kept despite the heavy traffic. there was a lego rep for xmas handing out free lego and a small station for kids to make little bits. overall a great experience at the store. thanks.|1
this store has huge collection of clothes and everytime i go there to shop and find great stuff.the staff memebers are great to help amd gessia helped me with great purchase today..hats off to all the members and keep the good work|1
i have always loved the type of clothes they offer. the deals are always great. i got my graduation sandals from there and they are very comfortable. above that, i got one high waist jean which turned out to be a perfect for me. they provide amazing customer service and it's reasonable if you follow the offers.|1
nice store. lots of choice. wife loves all their clothes. great maternity selection. love the their glass lit lift the best tho. you must check it out. proper physechelic|1
huge branch located right next to oxford circus underground. loads of floors. generally well laid out. very nice and bright, welcoming. never 'looks' busy as it's so big and spacious. staff are pleasant. i don't often shop at h&m but tend to browse now and again like i did today. cheap and quality is fine. they have some nice things. would recommend.|1
amazing service! the store manager was nice and organized. she called another cashier at the counter when it got crowded. the staff was courteous and friendly! they have organized everything very well. men's section has all the collections for men and similarly women's section has all the collections for women. i strongly recommend the store for your shopping.|1
very wonderful, beautiful and elegant the food is properly cooked the taste is wonderful, the flavor is wonderful prices are very reasonable|1
i love that this h&m store is located in a convenient place in the back bay. i also love that their clothing is affordable. i also love that their jewelry is extremely affordable. i really, really, really love h&m.|1
i'm not much of a shopper, but i like this store. nice, casually fashionable stuff at a good price. a great selection of children's clothing on the second floor.|1
we really enjoyed our visit to h&m home... we found amazing stuff wich will fit great our kitchen... so excited well done|1
it's one of the few places on the saint catherine with wheelchair access, meaning i can actually push a stroller into here and there's elevators unlike other shops! the only thing this h&m could have would be a maternity and baby section, then it'd be perfect. especially since h&m is one of the few youth focused retailers that offers a nice maternity selection and really cute baby clothe. please bring them to this location! edited october 2019: thanks for adding a huge baby section holla at me when you bring maternity and i'll basically live here.|1
bought this beautiful long ribbed dress from h&m! i tried it on and it fit me amazingly! i love it so much. i feel like this location h&m has more stuff than the other location i guess because this location is bigger! still very beautiful and modest dress|1
i will be brief, i know what it is to work with the public and more in a store like h&m, and the other day i was amazed at the treatment of a portuguese girl, she was blonde, about 30-40 years old, she attended me with a sweetness and delicacy that reminded me why i work in what i work, i go many times, and i don't have a single complaint (maybe in the oxford circus if i would), but here i just say that all of you are wonderful, thank you portuguese girl, you are great.|1
it was an amazing experience while i visit h&m, eaton centre. i found wide range of design, colors and size options. i would like to suggest, please go for indian shirts and trousers for your smart looks and comfort!! you'll be definitely benefited in terms of cost, comfort and looks!!|1
man, some of the customers are excellent, wonderful people. some of them not so much. sometimes i want to just end it all, but my team keeps me alive :) great clothes... sometimes...|1
very clean great prices staff was excellent and super helpful|1
a huge clothing store with amazing and lively staff and great prices. it has a wide range of clothes with different designs for everyone with any age from 6 month-old babies to the grown adults of 50's. the place is very well maintained and the service is pretty quick regardless of crowded place.|1
i come to this branch for the kids wear. it is usually organised and neat and i normally find great, stylish stuff for my little ones. this branch also has a home section with such lovely items. staff are helpful and hard working and queues move quite quickly if they build up. this branch is located on regent street which has some more expensive stores and so it's like a breath of fresh air having an h & m on that line up !|1
i like the rate of change in the collection at this particular outlet. there is a shuffle of clothes displayed on the rack, almost, every other day. i dig the color palette of their clothes. it's often very preppy and casual. the price is affordable. the staff is sweet and helpful if you are respectful especially the ones in charge of changing rooms. the rooms are kept quite clean and they smell nice. the place itself is accessible. it is right on the side of the mall metro exit and in front of yonge dundas square. can't miss it. there are two eaton mall elevators right beside the store.|1
perfect time to visit this store, i would say is early morning literally within the first or second hour of opening. store was organised and not too busy so was able to have a good look around. a large range of items across the three levels. women's clothes dominant the store of course and you can find something to suit any budget and age. they also have a small beauty section. store is pretty amazing carrying accessories, swimwear, lingerie, footwear, sports wear, children's wear, men's and even a small home section. staff on tills are friendly and really helpful with a query i had. didn't have what i went in for (beauty item) but came out with other things i needed. good overall store.|1
i love that they have clothing attire for almost every occasion and their pricing is not so bad. i love their winter collections and will most certainly be back. i recommend|1
"this was a whirlwind of a shopping trip. i went shopping the sunday of the black friday weekend found three pairs of pants, a shirt and a cardigan. when i went to be rung up, they told me that if i brought in a bag of clothes to donate they would take an extra 15% off. it just so happened that i had a bag of clothes to donate back in my car in cambridge. the cashier offered to hold my items while i got my clothes to donate. before leaving i asked the cashier what time they closed and she replied ""9 or 10. i don't remember"". so i went home, did some errands, ate dinner and grabbed the bag of clothes. at this point it was 7:40. when i looked up driving directions back to the store, i saw that the cashier was mistaken and the store closes at 8 pm on sundays. after quickly driving over to back bay and i arrived at the store at 8:00 pm on the dot. the cashier who told me they closed at 9 or 10 was actually at the door and was initially not going to let me in. she then remembered me and said she'd talk to her manager. her manager, kingston, was amazing. he came over, let me in, took me to the register, called over his coworker jade to help me and gave me 15% off for my clothes donation. jade was also quite pleasant and helpful. kingston and jade, you were absolutely wonderful and turned the whole experience around for me. cashier who's name i did not catch, everybody makes mistakes. thanks for helping me."|1
awesome customer service at this location. i bought a shirt super cheap but the cashier still told me how to care for it in the wash to extend it's life. i love it|1
i like this place. it is affordable and the staff help out with a smile. for the one at the pacific centre, the renovations are still on. the fitting rooms are upstairs so one has to climb stairs to get to them. a tad inconvenient i think. however, the options are huge and the variety makes it worth it. i am not sure how someone with physical challenges can manage this. work in progress i guess. check out the summer clothes. love the shorts and tops.|1
great selection and i've been loving the fall selection! but unfortunately the change room staff are just god awful and really affected my experience here. super unhelpful and just loudly talk amongst themselves even when customers are present! very unprofessional! barely even got eye contact when i approached the change room counter. despite this however the cashier staff are great and super friendly!|1
pretty nice mall, close to it all, easy access, great prices, wide variety, spacious and great food court options.|1
i love this h&m, the organization of the store is amazing, and seems to be the only h&m where the sizing is accurate. i'm a bit of a bigger guy and usually at other h&m's i need a 4xl which is not accurate, at this store i can always find a l or xl that fits perfectly. if your going to an h&m it's worth it to go to this location.|1
they have a awsome collection of cloths. love the quality of there cloths . kids cloths are just wow. nice designs and great fabric. store on vaughan mills takes covid19 precautions as well. allow only limited people inside the store.|1
i mean, let's just say my entire wardrobe is from h&m. i go shopping here seasonally dressed like i own the place, and i have customers approach me for help thinking i work there. fortunately, i'm knowledgeable on styles and colors currently on trend at the different locations. excellent staff. professional service and simply great sty! [excellent men collection.]|1
came to this h&m today to shop for my kid's clothes! avneet in the children section was such a great help. she helped me finding the right sizes saving me soo much time and energy! all the stars are for her awesome service! it's services like this that makes me want to come to this location again!|1
this h&m location is superb. recently renovated and expanded, this store is the largest h&m i have ever seen and it includes h&m, h&m man, h&m kids, and h&m home branches all in the same store. there is always a great selection of products at affordable prices. if you are looking for clearance though, you should try another location as this location doesn't typically have much clearance options due to its high-traffic location, dependancy on tourist revenue, and iconic status in the eaton centre. overall, a fantastic h&m location and a great place to find new clothes, shoes, and home decor.|1
this h&m is located in the eaton center just at the dundas square. it is a big store with a good collection of clothes and apparels. their prices are reasonable and competitive. we like this brand because of the quality of the products. so far, we have positive experience at this store. we actually come to this place quite frequently as to get access to the mall. outside h&m, you will find some gathering and events that make you feel lively. i would definitely recommend this place.|1
vibrant collection for shopaholics. love their collection of joggers and graphic tees. also, great jackets and accessories. the staff is super polite.|1
i have been shopping at h&m granville since coming to vancouver a few years ago and have always been happy with my purchases and all the employees for the help they give me. today, my purchases were cashed out by avneet. apparently, she is a new employee -- it's her first day working after her training! she is already such a pro! very professional; informative and an affable young woman! congratulations on hiring another great person to represent your company!|1
tis was a good experience. they have social distancing in place also the staff are nice. i was waiting in the queue and the young lady at the till was taking forever like super forever. then another young lady came over and opened up another till, she served me and the original till lady was still serving that same customer. so a nice touch there of customer service.|1
it was great the staff was very friendly and helpful, some are cute to, lol|1
one of the best h&m stores there is. smart, well stocked, clean, and vibrant, modern design with a huge display wall at the back. men's is on the upper level.|1
one of the largest h&m stores in london and perhaps the only one with the largest section dedicated to kidswear and maternity wear. i love buying children's clothes from here especially the colours for boys are so vibrant! sleepwear used to be great too but, now the styles have become a bit boring! the reason for 4 stars is because this year the styles are quite dull and drab which could be due to post-lockdown effect, not sure, but pretty disappointing. the queue in the women's fitting room can get busy on the ground floor. the accessories section is good as well but not as good as the branch in oxford street. definitely a great place for kidswear. hope they can bring back the great styles.....|1
great place, get great help from mr marten, the person working in men's department. really great person.|1
i went today to h&m regent street i was served by the guy called dareen i want to express his excellent customer service i've had with him he's absolutely amazing worker thank you so much dareen and hope to meet people just like you|1
la tienda es de buen tamano, lo que me gusta de esta tienda es que tienen ropa con disenos de la marca y de licencias por ejemplo de nasa, disney , etc. el personal es muy amable y te apoyan en lo que puedan. te ayudan a encontrar tallas super rapido, lo que no me agrado es que estaba muy desordenado. the store is a good size, what i like about this store is that they have clothes with designs of the brand and licenses for example from nasa, disney, etc. the staff is very friendly and help you in any way they can. they help you find sizes super fast, what i didn't like was that it was very messy.|1
staff was great. i loved miss ann shes amazing. freindly house keeper. did everything i asked for everyday without hesitation. my husband is a truck driver and miss sara the manager allowed me to stay as lomg as i need until his trianer got there. pet freindly hotle but gotta tell u. rooms didnt smell like pets. we didnt hear and pets the whole 2weeks we were there. prices are good. and the restaurant s are just a walk away. and 5 min from harrys new orleans style resturante. omg you habe to try it. anyhow hotle is between tampa and orlando. safe neighborhood and respectful ppl in the area.|1
nice collections at a great location as usual clothing at h and m is of good quality. huge shop with a lot of space and great ambience for a cloth store.|1
this is a great store for picking up some trendy pieces at a good price point. they have a great variety of clothing styles and some great accessories in their jewelry section.|1
probably the last mall polk county will see if eagle ridge ever finally shuts down. the mall is kept up pretty well and seems to be doing pretty well in terms of success. would probably give five stars if it was able to fill all of the storefronts with better stores.|1
amazing selection of men's tshirts they are available in various body types and fitting styles. so that in itself is a win + the good pricing they also have a nice selection of jeans, jackets, formal wear etc. good place for everyone to find somethjng they can wear|1
pal is an amazing stylist and has great attention to detail. my experience was enhanced mostly because of the care with which all the options were presented to me. amazing concept by h&m!|1
great for three levels of family shopping. location is great for downtown customers & toronto tourists. entrance from street and inside the cf eaton centre mall too. always college & university students are shopping and all students get discount too. also in this h&m location carries home decor items too. great for holiday gifts shopping too.|1
just a stone's throw from their store on oxford circus, but this one is far superior. it is much bigger and consequently has a much better range of clothing. for guys look out for their collaborations with big name designers. whilst the girls are queueing outside to get in, we can go straight upstairs and check out the men's section :)|1
the lights in store are very hot but a lovely shop for kids clothes great value for money|1
this is a great place to get needed clothing for cheap. in october, i needed to get a pair of black shorts for work. it was hot outside and the fall clothing was in season. however, they still had some inventory for the summer left, and it was convenient that i didn't have to sweat my tomatoes off wearing black pants on a hot and humid day. while there, it was nice to see that they give discounts for returning used clothing back to them in an effort to recycle. the impact that this has on our environment and the effort that h & m takes to give this opportunity makes me more cognizant of buying their stuff. i will say, it tends to look fashionable, not derelict-y enough but there is always a slight consideration to buy their stuff. the recycling they offer and the discount because of bringing in their used clothing is important in my consideration. always clean and friendly, expect a greeter at the door and at least a few people in front of you at the register, but you will get out fast enough, its fast fashion, after all!|1
great layout, well organized and well stocked. love this place for it's basics and on trend items. the quality has big range and you get what you pay for so don't buy their cheapest items and you should be happy.|1
great store, very clean with interesting layout, helpful staff and good selection.|1
h&m, it's awesome. always down to buy inexpensive clothes that are pretty stylish. good experience at this location. would recommend. stay classy.|1
one of the best malls still alive. food court is awesome and store variety is wonderful.|1
always good experience.staff is friendly and helpful.store is clean and organized.only draw back is every time i shop small sizes in easy iron shirts and super skinny pants and chinos is lacking.|1
good for men's clothing, missing variety in the type of men's wear though. will mostly just be a great source for the entire colour spectrum of t-shirts, shorts, and sweats. clean and employees are very kind and helpful!|1
"great selection! friendly staff! awesome location! i couldn't of asked for anything more! i've been to some h & m stores where you can't help but wonder.. ""why do i even bother to shop here?""... bc the customer service is sooo bad. but this (thank god) was not the case! one of the best shopping experiences i've had at h& m thus far and i'm happy to say i will be coming back!"|1
really nice clothing store! there is a wide selection of clothing for kids! staff is really helfful. really nice clothing store! overall a great clothing store! i highly recommend this place!|1
i was checked out by sarushti who was amazing she greeted us so politely acknowledged my 7 year as well and offered us to sign up for h & m rewards and helped us get an additional 10 percents off. the deals were great to begin with and the store it self looked and felt very organized!|1
mckayla at the newbury st store was so helpful and very friendly and welcoming helping us checkout. we definitely be back to this store!|1
our go-to for good quality, fashionable clothing at reasonable prices. kids' clothing, especially, is very high quality and washes well. women's clothing, as well. love this blazers and trousers- favourite work pieces. this store is well organized and easy (enough) to navigate, considering it spans multiple levels.|1
the clothes are worth it , i dont think you ll get the best fitting wise , otherwise clothes are good . staff is friendly, they have the ladies and men sections on different floors , sales usually going on , reasonable prices.|1
always find something i like at this store. super big with lots to choose from. lovely organic cotton basics too. often have great scarves too (can be used as hijabs)|1
h&m is a great shop for cheap good quality clothes. it's very nicely priced. perfect location in london and aways busy.|1
this mall is okay, i guess. every time i go i try to get in and get out as soon as possible. the last time i went i saw a guy get tasered like 3 feet away from me. if you can go to any other mall i would recommend that you do, but if this is the only place close to you its not too bad they can definitely improve.|1
fairly affordable clothing that keeps up with style and quality. staff are very friendly and helpful. the store keeps up a sustainable mindset as well, often giving out discounts for staying sustainable. the layout of the store is fairly open and well organized, making for an easy way to find the clothing that you need.|1
love this store. great selection. good prices. nice staff.|1
h&m regent street is a really good store. it's a good size that there's a lot of choice available. there is also decent staff to help out. it's especially good for sales :)|1
h&m used to be an affordable fast fashion store with trendy clothes. they now sell $60 sweaters and $100 dresses, but their quality has not improved. getting harder to find good clothes here. i do love their kids section and this location has a great selection.|1
go in there when my wife is in town. seems a large spacious, well laid out shop. good for clothes and accessories. my wife likes it but my credit card doesn't. joking aside seems a good shop and is always pretty busy.|1
i like the selection they have here and the deal are great. the custmer service is ok. i wish they would be more welcoming when you enter the store or something. its cool though|1
hamdi who served us is amazing - great and friendly service. credit to the store|1
very good value for money, please have more wool in your jumpers , happy to pay more for better winter clothes quality|1
h&m at vaughan mills is a decent store to visit when looking for mens or womens apparel. the quality of clothing is not the best but fair for the price points. the store follows covid-19 protocols and ensures everyone has a mask. the store is somewhat clean and organized. i'd recommend visiting other apparel stores but h&m is good enough as well.|1
love love love|1
love love this store. stocks the best blazers around|1
i love h & m, never a time a left the place empty handed. so many fabulous items you can get at a fair price. the place is always on the go with current trends which what i love about them|1
great experience great options. a very clean well run store|1
good range of clothing at affordable prices. great staff, very friendly and helpful.|1
the store has a great selection of clothes at a high price though. the colors are not exactly unique in their range of avalibtes. although their clothing patches are fun and cute. their range of accesories are low to midrange at best.|1
i love this location because they always have a lot of variety and the store is kept in pristine condition being in a downtown location. i can find dressy clothes, business clothes, casual stuff, accessories, and even bikinis here. this is my favorite hm to visit around boston where i live so it must be the best!|1
"my friend and i went there yesterday, and an employee named sam at the store was really helpful. my friend had a ""brilliant"" idea of paying for her stuff in coins. it was full of 5, 10, 25 cent coins. i felt really bad that sam had to count them all, but he kept on saying it's okay/don't worry with a smile on his face. wherever you are, sam, you're the mvp of the week. we'll never forget your good deeds from that day, and i hope that your manager read this (because you deserve a pat in the back)."|1
the new location is really nice, they have better size runs but the staff is just horrible. can't run the change rooms to save their lives and seem to be overwhelmed with the smallest task. don't even think about asking them for a size because it's not coming. the cashiers on the other hand are lovely.|1
great food. great staff. great music and atmosphere|1
h&m store is next to piccadilly circus underground station. the store is divided into different sections. the basement consists of men clothing. the ground floor and upper floors has women and children clothing. you can find latest trendy as well as formal dresses here, including shirts, t-shirts, trousers, coats, jackets, tops, jeans and party wears. the staff is user friendly. you can also use one4all gift card. the store also has its own card.|1
quite good brand and prices are reasonable, product design and qualities also good, i like the seasonal clothes especially kids clothes are nice subjected to heath and safety.|1
tremendous sale going right now! love it there cause they try to keep things organized and clean all the time! they do such a great job!!!|1
not as big as i thought but well stocked great staff and easy to get around|1
there is a nice selection of anchor stores, but the smaller stores change way too often. the food court has a good enough selection. i just wish the map on google was better and kept up to date.|1
my best friend girlfriend found.a nice bag in 15mins... good experience, a lot of choices|1
very good location, easy access. prices were good. can't comment on staff except for cashier who was great! he was very personable and efficient. the only reason for the 1 star reduction is there seemed to be too many areas where it was a tight squeeze and hard to move around/past items, but otherwise it was a very good experience.|1
love this store. the staff are wonderful. great customer service|1
i love h&m its my favourite place to shop ,great prices. and my grandaughter loves it also|1
beautiful vibrant clothes. clean, neat and tidy. parking available located in westfield shopping centre (stratford). food courts available.|1
found exactly what i was looking for, at a good price. if you have the app, you can get some discount - which is always worth getting. staff helped me set up the app, so i could take advantage of the discount ...... now that's looking out for the best interest of your customer.|1
really good place. lot of rush!! good prices!! people are nice!! spotlights they use make u look better in what you are wearing. lot of selections!!|1
itself, the store is very well merchandised and stocked. staff as well, have always been very friendly, approachable and helpful, without being pushy. particular shout-out to steven (stephen?) who helped me with reserving many cushions over at the shepherd's bush store. dream team!|1
i enjoy shopping in this store. friendly and warm staff, lots of options, a very organised store despite heavy traffic. i enjoy shopping here! a must visit for casual wear!|1
pros: good variety of stores, family friendly, the movie theater is super nice and cheap cons: people smoking right outside the entrance or vaping inside, needs healthier options in the food court|1
i've just received some amazing customer service from ruby and wanted to share - thank you! very happy customer|1
avneet was amazing today! i was needing lots of help sorting out clothes for my kids, and she was great! she also showed me how to find my membership number and the 3 for 2 deal!|1
very clean, beautiful. the 2022 collection there now is very clean lines and focused on shades of grays, beige, black|1
the renovations are beautiful! it's always a little mess, but it's h & m, so it's always like that! the second floor for women is great.|1
have been looking forever for white cotton tube top, strapless bra for a certain sundress. finally found the perfect one at h & m for about $17 cad. thrilled. eyelet cotton is pretty and very comfy. doesn't fall down becuz has side wire.|1
better than a lot of h&m i have seen in ma. have useful stuff. located in a great hanging out spot. lot of other shopping places and nice food spots.|1
it's a good department store like riachuelo c&a and others in brazil good clothes at good prices i like to buy in this store|1
lindisima la ropa y los precios super accesibles. beautiful clothes and super affordable prices.|1
thank you very, michelle, for your help, patience and guidance! it was my first experience using instacart, and i was having some difficulties. i was given a task to pick up clothes for my uncle who is getting married. i picked up a women's blouse and kids pants for my uncle. lol! michelle was my saviour who didn't make assumptions and constantly communicated everything over the app. she asked all the right questions and quickly figured out my mistake. she helped me pick the right clothes and guided me every step of the way! thank you very much, michelle, for going above and beyond the call of duty! it was already a very stressful day for me, and your presence of mind saved me! i wish you all the success in the world.|1
fun usually have good or great time alot to do ,but i also do think security show act a bit nicer|1
came here a few days ago and was bringing some clothes for my friend into her changing room. the lady behind the desk at the changing rooms had a bad attitude towards customers and wouldn't let me go towards the changing room my friend was in and had a go at me for trying. i didn't get her name but she has a strong foreign accent. other staff members were lovely but this one... not so much.|1
nice place good staff cooperation. little busy with the line. but that's what you can expect with the store serving well and good collection. recommend|1
i'd never had a bad experience here until recently. i was in h&m kids and my autistic brother attempted to hug a mannequins this man suddenly appeared and looked as though if i hadn't seen him, he would have taken my brother's arms and physically stopped him. if he's a customer then this is a weird security issue. if he is an employee i would like to give some advice on handling future issues like this. 1. without attempting to touch the child, speak to the guardian. alert them of the situation- they probably didn't notice. if necessary explain the risks and tell the guardian that the child cannot be doing what they're doing. 2. if that does not work, alert a security guard to explain it to them again and to tell them that if it happens again they need to leave the store. 3. if they still haven't kept the child from breaking rules have a security guard escort them from the store.|1
i am probably not the right person to say something about shopping stores, but there is a nice place to relax when you wife shops :)|1
normally the people here are nice and friendly and the service is good and fast when it's not peak times such as the weekend. aside from the fact that once i was asked by an associate to prove i qas was with virgin mobile because of a discount i was using which i did not appreciate. also, i bought a bathing suit before my trip and the associate helping me forgot to take off the huge tag / security sensor thing so i couldn't take it on my trip.|1
clean nice assortment of stores and a good clean place for small kids to play|1
huge store and selection. staff are helpful and friendly. houseware section has beautiful items!|1
i am so in love with h&m home. wonderful ideas to help you turn your home into somewhere stylish and special. without it looking like an 'ikea' home - if you get my meaning. going back again soon.|1
really good collection. excellent value for money. quality is good too. i personally prefer shopping for clothes from this place most of the time.|1
good prices for decent quality items. great staff and awesome location!|1
great store, really great prices. it somehow feels like an upscale store in the middle of manhattan, but it's here in beautiful boston.|1
encuentras muy buenos basicos. ropa simple pero de telas muy comodas. accesorios lindos pero no muy buena calidad. zapatos lindos para el precio. compre tacones de emergencia para un evento y me sirvieron de maravilla. tienen un programa de descuento cuando llevas una bolsa de ropa que ya no vayas a utilizar. ellos lo reciclan o lo donan. you find very good basics. simple clothing but very comfortable fabrics. cute accessories but not very good quality. cute shoes for the price. i bought emergency heels for an event and they served me wonderfully. they have a discount program when you carry a bag of clothes that you are no longer going to use. they recycle it or donate it.|1
great selection of clothes and the employees are all so friendly and helpful.|1
great options for cute clothes! really good prices. certain racks are really crowded so it's hard to get clothes off of them|1
lovely shop, great range of stock except for fun tights which is what i set out to purchase.|1
out of the 3 stores within walking distance this is the only one that has kids clothing. easy store to navigate around and prices are moderate. quality of materials is excellent and the designs are inspiring. staff are helpful.|1
brilliant store. great customer services. helpfully staff.|1
super impressed with how this location has handled sanitization re: covid. they stagger changerooms and thoroughly wipe down in between people. this is the most i've seen done at any retail clothing store. the selection here is also great as it's quite large (3 stories).|1
super encantada con esta experiencia super delighted with this experience|1
good nail varnish selection. love their jewelry and home section as well. they do have some good buys.|1
huge store, great price range. they actually carry sizes bigger than an 8. the staff was nice enough. can ask for much better in a big box chain|1
needs more stores. dead mall at one end. but food court actually had good food. mall was clean but i personally would like more decorations during the holidays. kinda blah.|1
awesome fish tacos, drinks are good, service can be great or sub par depending on your waiter.|1
the male section is on the bottom floor but it has a large selection and the staff is nice. the store itself is clean and it's easy to get to the rest of eaton center too after you are done shopping here.|1
great clothing for a reasonable cost! the tops look appealing and bottoms are one of a kind. every visit to the mall guarantees a visit to h & m.|1
nice shopping experience in h&m! thanks avneet for your kind help.|1
everything is overpriced in mostly every store but i like to look around anyway i like the game attic store which has old school nintendo video games and original xbox video games i'm mad that they got rid of the pet store because i would always go in there everytime.i really wish it was a two story mall that has escalators so it could have a lot more stores that would be cool|1
great place to shop.... amazing deals.... lots of options and variety of items.... specially their collection of items for petites really helps as many other stores are always out of xs items!|1
somewhat clean and very claustrophobic. well organized store. friendly employees. great service.|1
loves to buy my clothes here because it is not too expensive, i wish we had more big size like on their website. and i hope one day we will have more clothing choices because i visited some h&m which has more clothes for men than here.|1
nice place to shop. great food court. jc penney store is great.|1
brightly lit store with a great layout but their range is simply too 'highstreet' for me. however, you do get what you pay for, is always well stocked and great customer service.|1
team are fantastic and the layout is easy to understand and find items you're looking for. their selection is good, store is clean. only downside is the amount of teams on tills, always one or two and always have to wait 10 mins to be served. worth it though|1
great diversity of clothing, well ordered, easy to find, good price|1
wow what a big h & m. so many floors and so much to see, i was very impressed. well organised and covid secure.|1
a very busy location, but always slightly messy due to the high volume of customers. the staff are constantly restocking and refolding, so it's not as though the store is being neglected. the cashiers are very friendly and the floor staff are helpful. with 3 floors, i always find many items i want. everything is always on trend and the sale items are ridiculously inexpensive. the sizing is consistent so, once you know your size, you don't necessarily have to try everything on. the have a generous return/exchange policy, which makes returning items super easy, if you find you've made a mistake. their jeans, in particular, are extremely well-priced. this is my go-to location.|1
i love h&m they are amazing when it comes to trends and fast fashion. the only thing that continues to concern me is the ethics of the business. are workers around the world provided a safe work environment and a living wage?|1
always a great place to pick up beautiful clothes at a good price|1
clean, lots of lovely things ! well spread out, fab|1
love this mall. wish a few stores weren't so crazy priced. but other than that, this mall has a great selection.|1
super fast service, very clean. perfect for lunch|1
great clothes, great prices, excellent location. however, not very well organized|1
very good store.. nice friendly staffs ! well priced many choices|1
my fave place to buy good clothing. the only problem i have is the fitting. since i'm asian, i have problems with the sizes. but, you have to be very keen on checking the items before taking it. over-all, it is awesome!|1
sam is the best cashier si far my experience at h&m. giving suggestions and have patience with customers he is number one in it. god bless you.|1
needs more staff in areas but overall amazing place to shop peacefully|1
always like this location, it's perfect spot, staff always nice and helpful|1
my daughter got got lucky here with a pair of cut-offs from the sale rack which fit her perfectly when she tried them on. okay ambience - less snooty and bombastic than topshop and not frenetic and headache inducing like westfield's primark. my daughter didn't like shop mixtape though.|1
good location and multiple floors. staff is helpful and lots of sale areas. easy to navigate around but dressing room.gets crowded fast much less the while place can get crowded easily. easy to find it in the mall.|1
great place to shop. fit into bugdet. great quality clothing|1
beautiful clothes, always in fashion with elegance. excellent prices.|1
always love an h & m.! can always find something that strikes my fancy and won't even scratch the surface financially. more importantly, service is good. there is never a long wait. thanks h & m!|1
small, but nice. i liked the rental scooters shaped like animals|1
este lugar m&m home es una tienda genial tiene 2 pisos y hay ropa para hombre y mujer y los precios son variados con una atencion excelente this place m&m home is a great store it has 2 floors and there are clothes for men and women and the prices are varied with excellent service|1
the lakeshore mall is a fun place to go. watch a movie, play in the arcade, get overpriced mall food, hope your favorite stores haven't shut down yet because the man is slowly dying.|1
staff is ok, i've been to better stores in other cities, be more friendly and show you love the brand at least|1
the mall is slowly getting better and adding better stores. it's very nice and always clean. has all the usual stores.|1
really good time. loved the two girlies in the front. caught an employee lackin'. copped some really good clothes. 5/5|1
so many stores that were high quality have closed in this mall. macy's is on its way out, and there are cheap shops like nova that sell chinese knock-off goods that might last a whole week. save your money and go to a better mall. this one is good for dillard's, and that's about it. oh, and the food court does have some decent food.|1
great mall fun to hang with friends till you've seen every store|1
i really like this mall because it is quiet and have a good amount to offer. i wish they had more popular stores to choose from. their food court is decent.|1
loved this place. has got perfect outfits, got few tee for nightwear for $7. that's it for h&m. not bad.|1
they got so much stuff especially for work clothes. big store, but hard to find your size and someone that really want to help. cath is amazing. she took there time with me, helped find what i'm looking for and have more options.|1
i like shopping here. they have a good selection of clothing at a reasonable price. there are 2 floors of shopping. the ladies upstairs and the men's downstairs. the staff is friendly and helpful|1
very big 2 floors wow beautiful experience and clean dressing rooms.|1
lovely store. good veriety and options. prices are reasonable and the the quality of the products are excellent.|1
the mall is getting more stores again and nicer than it was for a while! hopefully it will keep going in the right direction! love all the food options.|1
the shop is on sales this summer.. a good time to visit. the counter lady was so pleasant and customer friendly.|1
great prices, great service as well.|1
nice store just wish there was better guy selection there for better price.|1
nice, clean and well structured multi story shop. excellent for finding fashionable and reliable clothing.|1
big store, good women clothing selection and not much for guys! love the place, tidy and welcoming|1
nice store, pretty spacious. never managed to get stuck in its rush hour so it seems pretty quiet to me. nice product for an affordable price|1
great location and very attentive staff. prices were very good value too!|1
good deal if you have time to look for stuffs. line up for trying but worth it if it is a deal. good value for cloth n accessories|1
they always have a good variety of sizes and design. this is my favorite hm store so far stocks are well organized and staff are friendly.|1
friendly staff... great prices... safe|1
nice mall. good stores. i like it. r stars room for improvement.|1
choice, checkout staff always friendly, a little less if you need help on the shelves, good value for money|1
good basics! also love the accessories. nice salespeople.|1
beautiful store! well organized as well as the staff. i highly recommend this location.|1
muy buenos precios, bonita ropa, me encanto very good prices, nice clothes, i loved it|1
such a wonderful experience. avneet was especially nice and helpful. she made my day!|1
this store has some nice pieces of warm sweaters for the season. nice fitting jeans for 25 bucks . good place to check out. you shop freely no one bugs you while you are shopping.|1
"once the main mall in the area, it is now run down and lacking many major ""mall stores"". they are trying to resurrect, and are attracting some new stores so hopefully it will return to its former glory."|1
always find great quality trendy clothing at h&m prices are very reasonable. nice styles & good selections|1
men's in the basement, women and accessories spread across the other 3 floors. they really have a lot of stuff. so if you like h&m clothing, this is the place to go. they have changing rooms on all the floors and wait times are pretty reasonable depending on the time you visit. i don't really shop at this brand as much as before because i find their cheaper stuff too cheap in terms of quality but this is still a really great store for shoes or cheap accessories.|1
great back to school clothes. wish they had more plus size :)|1
nice mall but it's small compared to others i've been in. pretty good food court.|1
it's a big h&m with a lot of concepts. modern classic, divided, everyday, kids, conscious collection, trend, men's, and even home... and they will defintely stock special collections when they come out. i'm probably missing some since i don't really shop there anymore but if you're an h&m fan, you'll love this store.|1
good space with good options . i love the homeware section more|1
it's a good trendy clothing store at affordable prices. most of the staffs are friendly. it has good selection of women's clothing and felt that it has limited options for men. overall good for affordable prices.|1
relatively good value for the price as it's not as expensive as topshop for expample yet provides very similar quality clothes. on many high streets whcih is useful. nice tees|1
good price. good location. love here.|1
affordable fashion across clothing, lingerie, shoes and accessories. i particularly like this branch as it is well stocked and surprisingly has less footfall than you would expect given the location, doesn't get crowded out, though you can't say the same for the street outside, always super busy.|1
great place, good service. could be more clean|1
genial estilo, ropa muy linda great style, very nice clothes|1
this is right beside my work. they always have some nice things and always really great price. staff is nice too.|1
excellent store with very helpful staff and very good selection of both menswear and women's fashions.|1
great place to shop for decent personal or professional clothing. the store has so much to offer and the atmosphere is so lovely.|1
good selection of high quality clothes and great prices. good for kids wear too.|1
good places to shop, with good food. plus they are great for black friday shopping|1
wonderful people. kind and helpful, as always|1
well stock, clean and tidy with tons of variety. would defo go again. staff are pleasant and helpful.|1
great deals! love my new cozy sweaters!|1
clothes great, staff great, the heat though. unbearable especially as you reach the 3rd floor. it's october. no need to heat the place like it's the middle of winter|1
esta es una de mis favoritas, amo la ropa bonita y mi estilo. this is one of my favorites, i love nice clothes and my style.|1
easy to find the perfect gift for your baby!|1
good choice of food places. clean.. great stores|1
simple and cheap clothes, perfect for work and standard items. friendly helpful staff from front to check out.|1
great year end sales, very bright lights, many designs, i bought many kids clothing value for money..|1
not a huge variety of stores and there are better malls if you drive a little farther (orlando). food court is great but lacks many great stores. not crowded so if you are looking for a mall with few stores and a small crowd, this is for you.|1
first time for me in this store, looks like they have similar good quality as zara and mango talking about kids area, but the difference was in h&m the variety is mayor than zara, because i find what i was looking for, after two days of searching, the only thing was my english is so bad for the employes of the store, sorry, i'm not good speaker but i'm a good buyer, but anyway things happen, after hard and ugly day i was thinking in relax myself buying some things for my little kids. but my english was good enough. i recommend you arket my god what a beautiful things are here.|1
this is one of the biggest h&ms i've seen, it's clean, big, with friendly service and a variety of clothes that won't kill the wallet.|1
super nice store, with different types of size and model of clothes you can find t-shirts, skirts, drees, boots different colors good prices|1
nice branch. a big selection and it has a home department which is nice. good location as well.|1
it is a nice mall. the anchor stores are good, the food court is nice, and the building is well maintained.|1
great location, many different stores to choose from & it has a nice clean food court with lots of places to sit & eat|1
great staff and fantastic customer service. worth the drive.|1
always find stuff i like in here, helpful staff and good value for money.|1
movie theater was nice clean and some fresh popcorn for the morning show.. that was a nice feature. typically its leftover popcorn from the night before.|1
if you're a h&m fan this store is for you, great collection and friendly staff|1
thank you sa 18106670 for your help and patience in my multi item return and purchase and coupon using transaction! he was great|1
love h&m. this location is great!|1
i love this h&m! always a great selection and multiple levels. right by the granville and waterfront skytrain stations.|1
best place to buy clothes for girls .. awesome prices !|1
i'm not sure what is going on with this review but h&m is not burlington, which are the pictures associated...besides that, h&m is typical. this is store is huge and clean. i wish they would carry plus size.|1
very nice .. friendly welcome ..|1
good store, lots of variety and definitely better and more stocked than the other h&m in town (the one closer to place des arts). you will find lots of cheap and in-trend items at this store. most styles are only plain though and single coloured, and nothing too crazy or stand out in the styles offered here.|1
hi anne marie (store manager)! thankyou for being so accommodating with my return today! i really appreciate your superb customer service!!|1
fabulous variety of styles and price range, and marked down items of clothing also pretty good.|1
awesome affordable clothes great place to shop!|1
super nice! i like the fabric and style|1
always good selection of sizes in all products! and staff always friendly & helpful!|1
the h&m store is reat and have a very good quality. the childrens cloths are fantastic, very good quality and my children love it very much. there should be more sales prices and somethimes there are diffrences between the stores. the prices are usually ok. i had a problem with the service at the h & m store at the oxford street. the appeal is not so good|1
love their sweat shirts so comfortable and their prices are reasonable.|1
h&m the big branch of store on eaton center it's located on three levels and there was all kind of clothes foe kids and men and women. the place was clean and the stuff was kind and helpful. there was a little crowded and there was a line to pay. the price is firm and the quality and quantity of goods are acceptable. i recommend it.|1
3 stories of h & m and shopping. it is a lovely store. the layout is nice and spacious. nice shopping experience.|1
nice winter collection. have plenty of jogging suits and sweat pants and basics .medium quality .there are sales on certain items. the above review was in winter. i visited recently in spring and they have sweet colorful ready to wear clothes and they give 15% discount on spot upon registering on line|1
one of my favourite stores you can sort the whole family out in one place at a really great price .... like the outfits like the one i'm wearing... @h&m|1
went here with my daughter, we bought her a childrens frozen watch/bracelet. the gentleman who helped us (i cannot find his name on our receipt just till 8 #5418) on the mens side cashed us out. he was so nice to our 3 year old and made conversation with her. even asked if he could put it on for her, she loved it!!!|1
this place is usually packed. clothing is mostly in place and nicely grouped in their proper sections so it's not terribly hard to find things. what you see on the floor, as i'm told by the employees is everything they have so if you don't see your size you're generally out of luck.|1
love it great store|1
love h&m great prices|1
great sales and selection for both men and women. love to come here for basics.|1
great large spacious store. would definitely recommend.|1
nice big store, missus couldnt find anything she liked bar the home section. mens section was pretty poor tbh from style to quality and 60quid for cargo bottoms.... have a laugh|1
good service, great promotion, cool clothes|1
best clothes, great sales|1
love this place its great for my kids|1
just wanted to say that customer service is amazing and specialty assistant called gloria one of the best service i ever had !|1
this has become my favourite home, decor and interior store. it's also got a lovely cafe you can get pastries, hot pasta and sandwiches, beverages and more. love the florist in corner of the store.|1
very cool store, excellent service, help and advice|1
a lot of discount available.. all range of products are available .. neatly organized and beautiful set up and decorations.. products are good and new|1
great clothes at great prices just need more for boys aged 8-15|1
great prices, great selection of items.|1
great store and they just renovated. great theme|1
great h&m lots of stock and great home wear section|1
great stuff and great staff|1
good fashion, wish they were more ethical in how their products are made and delivered.|1
good sized store, with lots to offer. staff are helpful and friendly, despite it being very busy!|1
i'm not a particular fan of h&m, but i do find something worthwhile from time to time. this h&m is the largest i have seen to date and has a massive selection. definitely worth stopping in if you have the chance.|1
love your mall i really miss jc and sears hope that you have good plans for it|1
great bargains to be had, needs to pay more attention to offer more larger sizing choices, fit and at times better quality.|1
good quality and affordable prices for woman man kids for summer or winter and even faction jewelery (not gold=gold filled or vermeil ) all you can find here easy access through the store for wheelchairs and access to free parking lot about couple minutes walking to bus station or sky train|1
nice and affordable clothes. good deals every time i go. huge variety as well.|1
has improved quite a bit. turned into a pretty decent mall. lots of nice stores now.|1
drop by loads of wonderful clothes great prices and value|1
today, i just visited a small briefly. i will say i am from southern california and this is very different line of clothing much more classy. the store upstairs and downstairs is very nice and i definitely want to go back before i leave vancouver.|1
nice big shop, very neat and clean. prices of the products could be more reasonable.|1
more or less same store found in other branch. however the staff makes the difference here. very helpful and friendly. constant genuine smile.|1
beautiful store great fashion|1
one of the few stores that offers a selection of work and play clothing. sizes are great and they fit regular people|1
h&m london unfortunately it is better than the branches of saudi arabia available in a beautiful variety men are rich in models and summer and winter species|1
nice and neat. friendly staff|1
good range of summer wear. really good prices and the quality is good too.|1
particularly fun place for the ladies. just ask my wife! great store, wide selection.|1
great selection of kids clothes and fab pieces for mommy too !!!|1
my favourite location of h&m. staff is helpful. i like the layout of all the clothes here. somehow the other locations don't cut it. and the prices are not too bad either.|1
this store is so big and so clean. just love it.|1
it's small for an h&m and the selection isn't that great but it's still a good store and they have some amazing deals from time to time.|1
pretty nice mall, good selection at the food court.|1
i was surprised with huge variety of displayed merchandise at toronto downtown branch i can always find nice things to buy at a good price at h&m|1
great place with amazing collections.|1
bonita ropa bien atendido. recomendado nice clothes well taken care of. recommended|1
this is a great store over several floors right next to oxford circus. a bit hit and miss for the larger sizes but great product ranges.|1
if clubs to reopen , this is where i would go to get disposable clothing i'm talking about v neck and crew neck tops for $5 if you really need a cheap pair of jeans for a special occasion that you're probly gonna throw out or spill something on, this is where you would go because it would cost you under $20 for an outfit. places like this are essential in this economic time period during the pandemic this store was the 1st to open their flagship store and stay open when stores reopen. they all were able to open during the end of phase one|1
the store is huge and the selection is endless, their place looks full and vibrant. the customer service is really good|1
there is very good collection for women. have nice collection for children and men. christmas sale was good.|1
the store is great but the attendants leave too much to be desired. nothing courtesy. but it has great prices.|1
really great selection, friendly staff. everything you'd expect from a clothing store.|1
grandisima tienda, varias plantas,todo muy ordenado, dependientes muy amables great store, several floors, everything very tidy, very friendly clerks|1
decent mall but much like all others it's slowly dying. could definitely be cleaner, but you can't expect much from a place on the decline. they still have a decent collection of stores though.|1
h&m was a wonderful store. they have a great location that is convenient from the tube. there is not much men's clothes compared to women. prices seem reasonable for london|1
pretty good mall. wish it had more variety of restaurants.|1
decent clothes, good service, decent prices. lovely sales, as well.|1
encontre las zapatillas que estaba buscando a un super precio i found the shoes i was looking for at a super price|1
nice linen blend casual wear pants and best price|1
nice place, the prices are really good, i took the opportunity to buy a few pieces|1
very nice specially when there's sale like today the report price quality is very good|1
some good 100% cotton quality tops and i like their recycling old clothes to get discount program|1
thanks for the good and polite communication with customers, the attitude is at the highest level, the quality is good, the choice is wide|1
flagship store, friendly staff, large selection for great prices.|1
although the men section is as small as it gets ( like everywhere else) the store is very nice looking and the employees are very helpful.|1
it's still a nice mall despite the some stores that shut down here. they still got most chain retailers still open at the mall. they could consider a remodel in some areas like around the food court looked the same for years not much changes here. the least busiest part of the mall is where the former macy's was and between dillard's and sear's section seem to have more empty storefronts. hopefully they'll be able to maintain it in the future if not it will end up like most malls around the country that are declining.|1
it was great cuz it is 3 huge floors and there are so many options and a lot of sales make sure to stop by!!!!!|1
excellent and very nice branch!!!|1
this mall used to be my favorite place to shop. it's definitely seen better days but it's still a good place to do some shopping|1
it's fine but they have security that likes to get slick with. you. for example me and my brother road our skateboard there. they are. allowed. security trys to take it because she doesn't like skateboards.|1
good prices and trendy clothing nice location and good amount of products|1
partner and i went into 2 other h&m stores for a particular item and was told that item was no-longer in stock in any of the stores. was even told by a staff in this store on the ground floor that it maybe out of stock but it would be on the 2nd floor if they had any left. asked a really friendly italian gent. who not only knew what she wanted but where. back on the ground floor near where the other staff member had been working. so thank you to him and your 4 is yours alone. should have been 5 but your colleagues let you down.|1
it's nice got a good selection of stores. it has a good food court.|1
receptionist is unprofessional but the artist's are good and makes you feel very comfortable|1
h&m is a amazing clothing shop, my daughter worked as shop assistant here for many years during the school time, and she had some massive discount! they have very decent quality stuff (better than primark) and at a just slightly more expensive prices. if you never visit this swedish multinational, you should!!|1
staff are not the best, but you will find cheap and best deals for sure i this store|1
this is a huge h&m store! i prefer the layout of the fairview h&m, but this one is pretty good. it's really hard to find things sometimes because you might have to go on a few floors. the service is always so-so. the associates at the cash are generally very distracted and the change-rooms' associates are generally gossiping. i love team spirit in stores, but i'm not sure that's what it is at this particular h&m.|1
this mall has a decent number of popular stores and is clean. it seemed a bit dark inside. the lighting could use a boost.|1
realy.. perfect.. amazing|1
love the variety of clothes especially xs and s sizes crop tops|1
fair enough prize for good quality|1
pretty big h&m, well stocked, very bright.|1
huge and very nice shop, with a giant screen near the escalators showing very choreographed graphic effects and attracting attention even from the street.|1
big shop with a nice collection. only down side is that there is always a very long waiting like to try stuff. the price is good.|1
i love the mall i just wish there was an arcade cause my friends and i always go there to hang out and we usually always do the same thing (shop and talk), but i think it would be cool if there was an arcade.|1
good price but clothes are more casual than uniform . good for youth only|1
should have given 5 but the security guard ruined it. telling me that my child is messing with the child size mannequins. stick to your job and secure the store by stopping shoplifters not children who just want to feel the clothes on the mannequins. love this location because it's the first i've seen with a housewares section. maybe the ladies and children's section should be on the same floor too; seeing that women are the ones doing most of the children shopping. it's a hassle to browse the ladies section then have to run downstairs to the children's... especially if you have a stroller and cannot use the escalator.|1
well kept and has great sales for ok quality clothes|1
good clothing and nice sales people clean store prices are are high could have been a little more organized|1
like their ranges. my favourite cargo trousers. great comfy casual gear|1
like the styles in this store. right now big sale 50 60 70% all items. don't know if they are closing down, but right now great store|1
good selection and variety at food court. typical mall setup and stores. would like to see some type of attraction or promotion to bring in foot traffic.|1
it is a nice mall. good big name anchor stores. clean. always slow and not a lot of foot traffic inside.|1
mostly i just visited the game shop there, they even have 1 copy of my favorite saturn game! hint: its $460 great game shop.|1
love the clothes, good price!|1
it's their flag ship next to dundas square. the store just got renovated i believe a couple a years ago . so it looks really good. from the lights and the design of the store to the collections they keep changing on weekly basis. def best h&m in toronto hands down|1
los articulos son de muy buena calidad y me encantan los especiales. the items are very good quality and i love the specials.|1
there was really good stuff and our family loved it, it had many stuff on sale that were very cheap and useful.we spend 3 hours looking around and buying stuff!|1
i think the clothes is good, but the pants are way too long and the petite size is only available over the website. i ask this girl and notice that they do help the guests but have this kind of rude attitude. even though i love the clothes, not too much luck for me in this occasion. covid safety: everyone wears a face mask (staff and guests), didn't see any signs of bathroom open or antibacterial available.|1
this is a huge location. the staff was friendly and helpful. however, not all of the changing rooms were open and the lines were too big at the ones that were open.|1
nice clean store with nice customer service|1
great selection of essentials, good if you need a quick closet update or you want a trendy piece for a cheap price.|1
excellent prices and nice quality, a good variety of clothes and the sales excellent. the only bad thing is the fitting rooms, they have loose curtains and a lot of people can see you from the mirror.|1
great for work lunch. pretty extensive menu.|1
the mall has improved a lot it is still quiet during the week (which i love) and more stores have opened, increasing the variety|1
we loved going to this location of h & m at vaughan mill shopping centre. huge collection of things for males as well as females.|1
getting pretty run down. the great decline of the mall continues.|1
always a great store to shop at, everyone is friendly.|1
great staff. wonderful managers. busy but staff always helps out if asked.|1
very good customer service , i used to work for h and m and service was great|1
good price and great quality clothes!|1
awesome store! can find fast fashion pieces at a good price.|1
the restrooms needed serious help. there where a lot of variety of stores to choose from and friendly store workers. the parking needed work. they needed more security outside.|1
jeremy was great, thanks for cashing us out so quick!|1
always great to catch a look...... homestuff is good looking!|1
gran variedad de disenos muy actuales para todo los gustos, sus precios muy buenos great variety of very current designs for all tastes, their prices very good|1
it's a great place for shopping and the location is really good. it can be so busy on the weekends.|1
ropa muy buena y a excelentes precios very good clothes and great prices|1
great h&m. very good.|1
super h&m home store: lots of decoration ideas and very beautiful vases combined with candles. top!!! too bad we don't have this type of store in france|1
fantastic store. hard to get staff to help with all the traffic in store but its a pretty busy store. affordable clothing and trendy styles.|1
nice clean store. just wish they had more smaller sizes in pants.|1
thank you josh for your help :)|1
good selection of the clothing and the store is kept pretty tidy. the staff are well informed.|1
great quality, nice collection!|1
it has really nice stores and great deals. the workers there are also very polite and interact alot with the customers.|1
the cinemark theater is awesome. very different movie theater experience with the reclining leather chairs and reserved seating. very nice movie watching experience.|1
yaz was most helpful. exchange was done seamlessly. great service|1
great prices, stylish clothing...and the employees were helpful!|1
nice shop clean very well laid out. good fitting rooms. not too busy but bought nothing feeling poor hence 4 stars.|1
i shop here all the time - very fashion forward, great prices, tip - wait for sales, and buy off season for the next season. i picked up a sweater for $14.00 and a nice faux snakeskin dress for $39.00|1
picked up some things for my daughter as h&m stock a size 4 and my daughter is very slim, which is great. my only issue coming from a retail background is the staff on the tills in most shops. they always look so miserable! i understand working long hours and some customers can be quite testing, however, some of these people need to may be work on their customer service skills! or just simple smiles would be a good start!!!|1
not too many good shops but it's got the essentials and it's pretty clean|1
a pretty decent h&m. there are two floors, mens in the first floor and womens and kids in the second floor. the sales here are pretty subpar, and the racks tend to get pretty messy during the busy hours. try to come early to beat the crowds, or you'll have to wait in line for at least 20 minutes to try on clothes, and then to purchase them.|1
decent prizes, great styles|1
good selection in food court. love that they have a burlington here.|1
i like going here. good variety of stores and clean|1
this is one of tbe best h&ms. it has a lot of products with good sales most of the times|1
good love it.|1
this tore on pacific centre is undergoing remodeling right now so the second floor of the women section is a bit messy. but it's a big store. the items are always neat and tidy. easy to find sizes|1
love the store. 2 stories, good staff|1
smaller the other h&m's but it is undergoing renos so i know great things are ahead for them|1
my favorite h&m in toronto, always has sizes . display is so not crowded. staff check up on you which is unheard of for this store. no matter where i am, i'll wait to get back to this location. second floor has great sales|1
good selection and great location|1
like to pass on always .. maybe i can get a something l like|1
great store selections, good prices.|1
great store, good location and i can always find my sizes|1
gran variedad y buenos precios great variety and good prices|1
love this shop nice variety of clothes for children's and adults|1
good to see in the day and time of online shopping you still have a great option of shopping in person.|1
good clothes. staff was great.|1
great store. good collection.|1
good variety and great sale prices|1
i love shopping in this store, always has nice clothing and so fashionable.|1
went to chick-fil-a they're always good they always get it right the chicken sandwiches are great|1
great store, big one, find for my 11 years old daughter what she need exactly . thanks h&m|1
the good the bad & ugly of shopping in h&m, 1st the good, l always find great clothes at reasonable prices 2nd the bad, you can't find any staff to help with sizes everything is really self service 3rd the ugly, l bought a suit at full price about four weeks later it had gone down to half price l deserve a badge for sticking with h&m|1
great place to shop-more stores would make it better|1
great for kids shopping, i always find good stuff for my toddlers. not much stuff for newborns though.|1
not much of choices with good qualities. but the kids section is perfect|1
a nice place for an air conditioned stroll around convenient shops and a tasty collection of fast food eateries in the food court. best bourbon chicken in town at the perry's bbq.|1
prices are good, i returned the products without any problems, i was satisfied with the customer service.|1
wait 45 minutes in the queue but great surface!|1
convientional h&m guy section is bellow ground but otherwise great!|1
some of staff are so lovely and helpful others are just plain arrogant and rude. however, love the products, hence i keep coming back.|1
bigger store, good selection & the usual prices. not to busy, parking easy. nothing special, no higher end style lines like downtown.|1
amazing deal of the day. throw pillow covers, 100 percent cotton at $1:99. they didn't last very long. beat that dollarama. spring is here at h&m. my favorite section at h&m eaton centre. housewares. h&m accepts cash, debit, visa and master card. they do not accept american express card.|1
1 star less because it is so popular that it is difficult to get help mostly on the week end. however the brand has improved their design the past decade and is now at a level of other big names in the industry.|1
they have great styles and nice prices|1
nice mall with a great variety of stores.|1
very convenient since we needed umbrellas & a rain coat for my hubby. he also picked up a great shirt. prices very reasonable & staff helpful.|1
nice variety of local and national stores with great food court.|1
a decent shopping place for nice fashion and eats. has a great food court|1
mall is improving which is great to see|1
love the home department, just wish there was a larger selection|1
best h&m i've been to - the staff were helpful, no attitude, the clothes were well stocked and the store was very tidy|1
buenos precios, locales amplios, bien cuidados. una buena opcion para comprar ropa y accesorios de uso diario good prices, spacious premises, well maintained. a good option to buy clothes and accessories for daily use|1
great place with nice deals specially on kids clothings.|1
fair prices. good store. wish there was more of a men's selection though.|1
an excellent place for those looking for cheap prices, especially good for children|1
very good store with a variety of clothes. approved !!!|1
muy bien hay distanciamiento y el personal muy educado me encanta ir a este centro. very well there is distancing and the staff is very polite. i love going to this center.|1
avneet was a great help|1
a current fashion- house. liked by the younger population which it serves well. good displays and decent staff. it's a part of the westfield complex with all its amenities.|1
big store of 3 floors with beautiful clothes for women (including maternity clothes), men, children and babies. they have a good costumers service. the prices are reasonable. busy store with lots of people. the prices for babies clothes are expensive.|1
outside looked like no one was there but once inside it was filled with people. also great selection of stores.|1
good selection of clothes at super reasonable prices.|1
great selection, decent prices. wish they had their european lines in canada.|1
great clothes for kids. wish there was more choice for boys (although this applies to all other retailers too).|1
you can find dress clothes and casual clothing at a reasonable price, the staff was friendly and helpful.|1
service at this location is excellent. i was looking for a specific dinosaur t-shirt for my nephew and i was helped by a very nice sales associate.|1
must be one of the biggest h&ms in the country! great collection, the store looks very chic.|1
the store is big, they have good sales and the manager really helped me out when i had some issues with a return. she was very honest and understanding!|1
huge store on 3 floors in the middle of regent street! beautiful and there is something for everyone!|1
this store has more selection than most! great range of sizes and no hate when o went to the lower fitting rooms when trying on mens clothes. very inclusive!|1
i had problem with my online account and i couldn't log in, at h&m pacific centre i asked a girls who is name is shalana. she was really nice, friendly and patient. thanks|1
they do not carry many items in size xs or small. but overall my experience was good and no complaints|1
i found good promotions. the only thing is that, it would be worth it if people did not leave clothes lying around and disorganize them.|1
they had a decent selection of clothes for both men and women in terms of styles and pieces but they dont have a good size range on the plus size end. the biggest size they have in shirts is 14 which, while fitting in some areas.. didn't fit in other areas (intentionally vague). store is two story and the staff is friendly but don't always take the initiative to ask if you need help. this is not always a bad thing as sometimes you want to peruse without having to talk to anyone.|1
lovely and spacious store where you find what you need at good prices.|1
lovely collection at a good price|1
excellent and sweet prices|1
centrally located in boston in a beautiful building with plenty of clothes and helpful staff.|1
love this place always find something there i like.|1
well, quite a decent collection for winter. could have been better for women. however, the overall collection from spring and summer perspective is definitely a thumbs up.|1
large well kept store definitely one of the better h&m stores about|1
i went during the sale and was pleased to find some amazing items. perhaps i won't have bought otherwise if not for the sale.|1
it was nice and clean. fitting room staff in the top floor, children section were not enough helpful as they supposed to be. i couldn't buy the clothes which i was interested.|1
cheap quality, but great style|1
best value|1
great for clothing basics like leggings and tanks.|1
ok store if u like thier style and good prices|1
great if you like the mall shopping scene has everything you need.|1
kids floor is excellent, welcoming and interactive|1
excellent women's and men's clothing and accessories store with attractive prices.|1
the foot traffic was well managed and displays seems well organized and sufficiently spaced. the staff i interacted with were courteous. really sucks that return of instacart purchases is store credit only though!|1
clean shop, nice staff, highly recommended, as everywhere at h&m|1
fun, very clean. lots of choices as to where to shop!|1
the sale event are totally worth it!!!! the other day i bought a decent cocktail party dress for about a fifth of its original price, which made my day, haha. however, i really dont like all the lights outside of the store. they are lit all day long, even during the day and late in the night, ridiculous!!!!!!!!! such a waste, imagine what good they could have done with that money ><|1
i've shopped at h&m since the 90s and always return for the shopping experience of space, good floor visual merchandising and great products and good prices. however the last 2 visits have been disappointing with very ordinary stock and poorer quality fabrics and choices. it seems the company is hedging oooh the safe bet with nothing interesting or quirky in stock. so i'm not purchasing as there's nothing i can't get anywhere else at equally good prices. pity really.|1
"they used to play good music here, but now it is kind of blah. there was a weird cover of mgmt's ""electric feel"" that was particularly offputting. the second floor smelt like someone dropped a bottle of perfume up there. reasonably priced nice clothes."|1
the men's selection is small, but what is there is well organized and there's a good clearance section|1
nice outfit for work .for casual to stylish ,you have a good choice|1
best h&m i've been to it's huge you can find just about anything you need and it's cheap.|1
most comfortable pants in khaki on sale for $15. i also got a navy knit dress that will look good when i lose some weight around my inner tube. i also like some of the bags. i will now be taken more serious by other people for wearing these pants and the khaki top. i bought a green jacket here for $10 a thick jacket to wear in winter in dark green satin|1
great value when is the sale period|1
i'm looking forward to getting my beautiful sequin dress here ear to wear for a night out out this weekend. it costs 35 and it's ridiculously gorgeous.|1
got here what i needed...always on sale items which is nice, got a cotton tees here for 6.99 perfect for summer|1
staff is nice, lets of deals on clothing for back to school for kids. could've find anything i like for myself, but for the kids was good.|1
great store. great prices. sometimes the personnel is a little rude.|1
was good, got what i needed on a blazing hot day! escaped the masses because luckily this shop is at the front. 2021 beh beh.|1
nice and warm, i go there when it rains to repair and sometimes pop in to charge my phone. highly recommend|1
while the blinding lights seem rather ostentatious from the outside, this is actually one of the better h&m stores i've been to. the selection available for men's clothing is also quite impressive.|1
friendly! :)|1
this location seems to have been under renovation forever. it set up as well as it can be however its 30 degrees today and feels the same inside the store. the clothing is great at an affordable price point!|1
huge store! i'm loving the selection they have and how the store is arranged|1
the home section of this h&m is why i'm giving it 5 stars... it's amazing!|1
i wish the cashiers be more friendly!|1
very helpful and nice staff!|1
great mall lots of stores. just wish they stopped closing so many. i seriously recommend perry's in the food court.|1
one of my favorite stores... but this branch is very poorly organized!! to review : - hygiene and sanitation - have staff on the floor - better manage balances|1
great place to pick up socks underwear a cool sweater|1
very good customer service, friendly staff even though place was packed.|1
had a good shopping experience everyone was very friendly and professional..|1
buen lugar y buena la cerveza! good place and good beer!|1
mall is clean, but activity is very low. i was hoping to find better sales at anchor stores.|1
amazing selection for a decent price. 10/10 would recommend.|1
visited to see some home decors in h&m and this only has very limited options. you cannot find lots of varieties, however, what they have is really beautiful. can find payed parking around the building for 2 hour from mon to sat(sunday is free).|1
is ok new look great prices|1
great modern clothes for cheap prices. only shopped for sale items and it was ok|1
very large store on several floors. well located in the dt heart.|1
an inexpensive way to stay within trend. very crowded; but worth it for inexpensive trendy basics. the quality here is definitely mixed.|1
it is a very crowded place all the time . so many customers goes here everyday. very nice decoration inside the showroom. separate place for men-women- children. and they have separate changing rooms also. this brand shop is very convenient and budget friendly. canada's first h&m store opened on march 11th, 2004 at toronto's fairview mall. the 12,000 square foot store was met with much fanfare and a week later, its second canadian location opened at the promenade in thornhill, just north of toronto. canada's largest h&m location (at 33,000 square feet) opened in the fall of 2004 at the toronto eaton centre.|1
i love this store, good and low price clothes!|1
pretty nice store!|1
a good place to meet friends, shop and work off those extra calories from the food court!|1
very good service 2 guys at the cash were very helpful|1
good sales! i bought some really nice trousers for 20 pounds|1
very good! h&m always have nice products and always change|1
its very nice good varieties in men clothes|1
grandes precios!! great prices!!|1
great place to go walk around and but nice clothing|1
great deals, impossible to enter this store and not buy anything, clean and organized. kind employees.|1
amazing place to shop for clothes! it's worth it, but really worth it!|1
2 floors busy all the time is located in the mall. well worth the wait. . professional staff friendly service wait times are high on weekends. $$$ moderate to expensive look for sales. customers are all treated professionally and in a timely manner .|1
excellent ready to wear store.|1
i like the verity in shops here. there is always a bunch of people of course, no different from most malls. has one story but in the perfect location.|1
it's always super busy and there is a huge line for a fitting room.|1
great selection of kids, women and men's clothing. reasonable prices. also have home decor, shoes, and accessories. highly recommended.|1
great selection of clothes from men to women stay stylish without breaking the bank highly recommended|1
clean and friendly with lots of choices!|1
love to shop in this h&m. but wish they could have home section in this store. since it's in dt area.|1
parkings always bad but clean and alot of good stores|1
my favourite store and is a big branch and i love the variety but once more i'll say the same thing the there's not enough staff on the shop floor to help customers.|1
"over the years this mall has had a hard time keeping stores open here. we go when its a quick spur of the moment trip but when we're seeking an actual mall we unfortunately have to go elsewhere. most of the more popular stores have moved around and taken up more of the spaces to make it seem ""fuller"" than it actually is. the food court options are pretty bleak. you have pizza, chinese, chik fila (if its not sunday) or more chinese."|1
nothing to get excited about but it's a great place to get exercise.|1
buenas ofertas y es bastante grande good deals and it's pretty big|1
good experience. found what i needed. friendly staff in the dressing rooms|1
large h&m with good collection and friendly staff.|1
pretty good h+m.|1
good store friendly staff|1
pretty good selection of stores.|1
great items but too vast constantly needed staff's help for navigation|1
shops are easy to find, friendly service.|1
this is a huge store and usually in decent shape. (far better than the downtown location) the home and men collection both worth a visit.|1
pretty good|1
4 floors of the well-known economic brand. amazing prices for acceptable quality. prices shown in pounds sterling and euros with an aligned conversion rate|1
decent quality, good prices, friendly staff|1
excellent value clothing.|1
it's okay at best|1
not one of the nicer malls in central florida. it's pretty basic and semi-clean.|1
when we arrived at h&m, it was pretty easy to find what we were looking for. the few time we needed assistance, the staff were available to provide it. it was a smooth in and out experience.|1
has a pretty good food court and a sears that hasn't closed down yet.|1
pretty good|1
good products and friendly staff.|1
i don't like the selection, but the employees are great. the sizes aren't inclusive, but what can i expect?|1
the clientele here are fuggin garbage. there are some decent stores and a really nice theater. i recommend avoiding most stores if you can though. unless you have a license to carry. then you're good|1
good very classy|1
good stuff, good price!|1
pretty bad selection for tops & basically nothing in the underwear and pj section. staff were nice though!|1
is comfortable! easy to shop never do a line to pay|1
buena ropa pero no tiene mucha variedad para caballeros. la ropa de mujer alguna muy bonita. good clothes but not much variety for men. women's clothing some very pretty.|1
incredible store with varied prices, i loved every corner and i already put everything in my pinterest folder!!!!|1
not my thing but the mrs loves it...|1
nice expansive store with quite a bit of selection from what i saw from the men's section. on the other hand, i could see that the sizes seem to become smaller and smaller with the years and the higher prices, if i take for example the jackets/hoodies that i have been buying every year for about 7 years.|1
nice friendly small town mall|1
it was massive as they have 1 on each level. i got there around 5:30pm and they close at 6pm so i did my shopping then it was 5:58 that's when the security came to me pushing me to get out like he would literally intimidate you to get out even when i had something to pay for. they clothes are okay but the nice ones are hidden so you have to spend a lot of time looking.|1
friendly and helpful staff. lot of selection with reasonable price.|1
nice shop.... got some pretty stuffs|1
nice and pretty cheap clothes|1
it's a nice mall, small enough to be comfortable, but with a selection of enough cool clothes to find what you're looking for.|1
this location has a small home decor section (dining, pillows, throws, candles, bed & bath) - trendy colours & styles - pricing was great. worth checking out.|1
friendly and helpful staff.|1
found an outfit for my daughter's halloween party but a few hours of walking i wanted to stop but your store was last on my list i was determined to get an outfit that day. thanks for that.|1
nice store and friendly staff|1
"""sears"" good and very helpful associates"|1
the staff seemed very helpful and they also have good collection for formal sweaters.|1
super recomendada highly recommended|1
good quality denim shirts and jeans at a reasonable price, and the staff are really helpful.....|1
good choices of clothes to choose from for little kids to teens. good.safety measure and staff is also very helpful.|1
i find this to be a really good branch of h&m with its recent launch of h&m studio line in store. a good selection of the more trend lead pieces can be found here, as well as accessories, shoes, kids and men's. no homeware here, there is a section in the store on oxford street which has the homeware.|1
always clean and neat!|1
helpful staff and easy to self distance!|1
nice clothes. good prices!|1
nice clothes, good prices!|1
igual que todos los h&m esta bueno para comprar! like all h&m, it's good to buy!|1
i saved 200 pounds when bought stuff on sale after christmas! came handy to give gifts when i went on holidays !|1
it needs a little more for the men...women have 3 floors practically and it's just some of the same stuff dispersed. men need a little more on the more useful accessories like hats/coats/some shoes. oh and more room for rooms...if that makes sense.|1
an okay selection of clothes... pretty poor quality but still fun to shop.|1
didn't find very many options this time especially for men...but by and large great for casual wear|1
i used to work in a stores like d&g,ea,gucci and i know what means buy expansive stuff.i also understand that give a lot of momey for just clothes its kind of,you know...h&m is the store where the price range and style makes me feel comfortable.thank you h&m you are one of my favourite brands.|1
organized and clean. they don't carry plus size. pretty things for young people. a little $$|1
big, organized and pretty clean|1
like spending time in this mall, to walk or to sit in the center just enjoying the time.|1
the clothes are nice, but the customer service needs much improvement.|1
very nice place with nice stores and people who work in them|1
women's, men's, children's clothing styles. many very good looks. housewares too! very surprising variety.|1
awesome store, great products, often buy t-shirts and pants from there and u can find decent tanktops and hoodies too. can't go wrong but it also depends what ure looking for.|1
it's always fairly peaceful and laid back during the day and more populated towards the afternoon. can be crowded but overall not a bad place.|1
getting to shop here more good value for money|1
i wish i visited h&m more often. pretty nice collection. i recommend buying tshirts from here, but not jeans or shoes.|1
4 stories, very clean. didn't have as much as i thought but overall good selection.|1
good clothes and good price|1
i liked the game kiosks in the mall. neat place to go and hang out.|1
good collection. nicely organized store...|1
honest, like all h&m stores|1
buenas ofertas y buena calidad good deals and good quality|1
reasonably good selection of stores-- not as crowded as some of the glitzy malls. good selection of food available.|1
swedish chain that offers good prices and good quality. a thousand times h&m at any forever 21. i bought underwear and socks there for the next 10 years.|1
aesthetically pleasing and i personally love the vibe of the store. there's cute clothes there but most of the clothes for the chilly season are overpriced.|1
good variety and good prices|1
good mall good food a movie theater is connected|1

good quality and good price.|1
always a good vibe in h&m good quality contemporary styles at prices that won't break the bank.|1
it's getting better. they are adding better stores to shop at instead of the same type of spread throughout.|1
good location for h&m in boston. one of the largest in town and with good selection|1
nice shop really clean, organised and fast till service.|1
very nice if you like h&m. very big. it also has discounted products.|1
very clean and spacious. the people work in there is helpful.|1
nice location, they have lots of staff on the floor to help!|1
love the size of the store ! it contains way more than a normal store has and it has a huge men's and home section. the only downside is the long lines at the cashier; they never seem to have enough staff available.|1
love this store rite uptown! vancity !|1
i love this place! for my children's and for me!|1
h&m home is alright. busy place due to being on regent street. some of the staff are nice and some just can't be bothered so they have their phone in their hand while you ask them stuff. other than that, they open earlier on sunday but you won't be able to pay anything until 12pm due to their license. don't waste your time going around and ask to pay before 12pm they won't do anything about it.|1
not too bad, a bit expensive but not much. but i couldn't find a lot of good & moderate tshirts there, may be it's just this location though. i'll try another next time.|1
not bad but can be better quality and style|1
bad service but got a nice shirt so can't fault it|1
nice clothing store didn't go in or buy anything but yet always hope to do|1
nice store not as big as expected but good|1
good prices and not too bad clothes.|1
small but pleasant shopping experience!|1
nice place with good prices|1
nice mall with good selection of stores|1
the store is big and many sellers want to help. but the store's policy of not returning money, according to them since brexit, doesn't seem to me... and quite a bit of money could have been saved by doing so.|1
nice selection of clothing at good prices|1
nice mall with all the good stores.|1
nice place and good collection.|1
nice shirts for good prices|1
great selection and easier to walk around no long queues.....|1

this mall is nice but could use some remodeling inside along with an updated food court. but over all not bad|1
i like h&m in general and this one is a wide one so overall it's better than most i'd say|1
very busy, and staff are not super lively, but they get the job done. anyways clean and a good selection of garments.|1
nice collection, latest trends, affordable pricing..gr8 discounts if you are lucky|1
special price with good qualities|1
clean, organized, good service.|1
good size store, i assumed it would stock a bigger range due to the size of the store. the children department is disappointing as it seems very small. the store is always neat and tidy when i visit. would be good to have more people serving when busy.|1
good, clean|1
good quality clothing for reasonable prices just wish they had more midi dresses|1
good small mall. clean and offers a movie theater.|1

good value for money!|1
i like this mall because it has the stores i like , right in my backyard!!|1
excellent!!!|1
nice little store with a wide range of clothing to choose from. it can get quite busy at times so i would recommend doing your shopping in the morning.|1
i love their socks, but i wish they did then in a bigger size, they shrink after a couple washes. there was also a problem when purchasing the socks as the cashier didnt apply the 3 for 2 deal, but it's a great shop and ill be returning for more socks|1
nice people clean environment..|1
nice clean mall, lots different stores|1
nice mall clean|1
big posters of huge discounts outside but very small portion of clothing was on sale with discount and even that looked old. i understand that it was because of covid situation but still other brands had better selection.|1
