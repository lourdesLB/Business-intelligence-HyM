4 months ago|Daiva Ažubalytė|Ah so disappointed. I ordered online, package came late and i was already on the trip. Just got back, tried everything and its too baggy, so i brought it to the store for a store credit as it was a little passed 30 days. They have all items in stock right now so i did not see a problem. Counter attendant was super nice but her manager was not, after checking that items are not used they tried to scan to return it but smh did not work and manager said that items cannot be returned, then i ask to exchange and its a NO.  I buy h&m very often especially for my kids but now I will choose Zara or GAP which are the same quality brands providing excellent customer service!!!|1
4 months ago|TJ Conwi|I spoke to a lady on the kids section before I bought an item and she told me that I could return or exchange item that I'm buying for my daughter. When it turns out that the pants I bought was too small for my daughter I tried to return it to the store. Without hearing me out or listening to my story, the clerk just said sorry its final sale. You can't return it. There you go. Without any compassion. Could it be that your staff made a mistake or miscommunicated?! As a brown person dressed in street clothes I felt like I was being judged when I walked in there. I honestly don't care about the money but I felt that it could have been handled a lot better . Better take your business elsewhere.|1

5 months ago|Gavy Gosal|Horrible experience at this store. Was demeaned and insulted by a staff member while trying on clothing. After contacting their customer service department about the incident, they promised some sort of credit, only to ghost me and ignore further emails. Guess this is acceptable to them. I have shopped here for years but will never go back again.|1
7 months ago|Sanaz N|Bad customer service!!! I am really disappointed with the service I’ve got from H&M today. I am a royalty member of H&M. Today I wanted to return one item of hundreds items that I bought online from H&M at this place( pacific centre) but since it was just few days past from 30 days they didn’t accept the return. I was thinking with my self that how much I have spent during last past years and how awful customer service I got. I asked the manager to just do the return this time for me since I wasn’t able to return the item which was completely unused from the summer collection and he repeated the policy for me and asked me to call H&M customer service and get the authorization. After spending an hour in that branch and trying to contact “Customer Service” their answer was the same. I am really upset at this time because I have never seen this kind of CS in Vancouver before. Never come back to H&M again!|1
2 weeks ago|Jay Lam|Not enough cashier's, cashier's do not listen to customers and added unnecessary charges.|1
8 months ago|Peter Burton|I bought two pair of shorts. Two weeks later, the zipper failed on one. When I tried to return that pair, the manager said, no receipt, no exchange. Shoddy products, lousy return policy, lousy customer service. Never again.|1
8 months ago|misun Joung|It's not worth the score.The customer service is so bad.The staff didn't understand the guidelines and contents of the service, so they spent half an hour, but they couldn't find a good reason. A place where someone who she like  to be a manager speaks cant English|1
10 months ago|Gurjot kaur|The cashier over there are so rude. They do not know anything about costumer service. I went there yesterday and the price was written wrong at one place abd the system was showing different price. When I noticed it, the cashier started arguing with me. I am a nice person and it was my worst experience. I would never visit at this location again.|1
7 months ago|Fernanda Reis|Do not shop at this store. The staff is the most unhelpful of all stores. H&M is already weak when it comes to customers service and quality but this store managed to be the worst one.|1
2 months ago|porsha|Employee rushed me out of the change room bad service|1
2 years ago|Guramrit Kaur|Really bad customer service. Right at 06:59, we wanted to exit the store. The girl at men's department was closing the shutter gate. We requested if she could open the gate, she straight up refused to open it and told us that we need to exit through Granville St. We then hurried up to female section upstairs.This girl up there was closing the door. We requested if she could open the door. She didn't say a word after this. My boyfriend apologized to her twice but she said nothing at all. At last, we said thankyou and she didn't even respond to that. The worst associate I have ever met in my life. Maybe the employees need to be a little nicer towards customers.|1
2 years ago|K Atkins|Apparently returns aren’t allowed Friday through Sunday which is a nuisance considering their dressing rooms are closed. How as a business can you select days when returns are and aren’t permitted not only is this super inconvenient it’s incredibly bold considering your located in a Monday to Friday business environment of business towers. Do better|1
a year ago|Miranda Lewis|They won’t let you return things in store that were purchased online, which is a pretty irritating and cheap company policy. Definitely not clear when making a purchase in their website. I don’t normally shop at H&M and this definitely won’t motivate me to do so.|1
3 years ago|Adam Potega|Several days ago I purchased a shirt. I was getting ready to go to work and put my new shirt on. What a surprise! The security tag was still on. Oh well, I thought happens, human error. I just went to the store to take it off, so after mere apologies I asked for a discount for the next purchase, as I had to use my time and money to get back to the store. Unfortunately we don't do it here, I heard from the girl at the cash register. She talked to the manager and he confirmed. I returned the shirt, I won't support this company ever again, there lots other options.|1
2 years ago|Amber Marple|WORST SERVICE EVER!! I like H&M and their clothing gives you a good bang for your buck. This location is the absolute worst though and I wouldn’t recommend shopping here. Multiple staff members were rude and unhelpful. The store is extremely disorganized and there are clothes everywhere. It seems like a lot of stuff but none of them know what they’re doing. I realize that it’s Covid and that certain stores aren’t allowing people to try on items, it would be helpful if they had signage at the front of the store that let their customers know that. Instead I ended up walking around with a huge bundle of clothes only to be told that change rooms are unavailable. The staff member I spoke to was rude about it.  To make matters worse,  I went back the next day to do some returns after I had gone home and tried everything on. The staff were again rude and unhelpful with the returns. I couldn’t believe the horrible service that I had here. Once again WOULD NOT recommend shopping at this location. You’re better off ordering online, you can’t try on there anyways.|1
a year ago|Pushpa Aryal|Hi, Dear management, just to let you know H n M pacific location has the almost worst staff. their knowledge is far far far away from practical situations. as i m a regular customer of H n M but it doesn't  matter to anyone then I will be doing no shopping from Hn M . thank you for making my day bad. honestly, i want to give zero star to the pacific location in terms of customer service n to the manager.|1
a year ago|Tanya Khanijow|"Pathetic customer service, specially a lady named ""ANNE"" on the front-desk. They behave so rude and talks like it's their own store. Sales person like this are actually spoiling the brand name. Sorry to say, but will never visit this store again (nor I recommend)."|1
10 months ago|Krystal Liu|This Indian cashier was so rude and impatient with every single word I said…..like if u don’t wanna work as a cashier then go find another job. Stop giving attitudes toward customers😅😅😅 …|1
2 years ago|Shahnaz Safa|Terrible experience!!!! The cashier, she was so mean!I Unfortunately I have to say it was my second and the last one I would never ever shop there. I personally work at retail for 10 years, eye contact, greeting it's the most important key at retail.|1
a year ago|PUSHPA SANGWAN|Worst return policies. If Something is torn, not even bother to exchange or return even if customer is  trying to do in within 24 hours. Thank you for a horrible experience Regards, H n M loyal customer.|1
5 years ago|Aiza Sajjad|The male cashier was quite rude and completely unprofessional.  My mother requested to get the price for a sweater because she was purchasing a size medium and all the small sizes were tagged as sale items. The cashier would not let her speak and he kept interrupting her stating that there is no sale on the item instead of simply scanning it to get the actual price. The manager I spoke to apologized repeatedly but didn't resolve the price mystery. We had to take matters into our own hands and go to a different cashier and let him scan the item only to find out the damn sweater was on sale. I will not be returning to this store due to lack of service. I don't expect extraordinary service but at least treat your customers like people! Terrible service and terrible management!|1
2 years ago|Mister A|"Was looking for jeans this evening. Asked the lady if she could help me with jeans. She didn't even make eye contact and said,  ""I'm busy doing something else right now, but I'll be back!."" goes to women's section to hang some clothes, comes back and walks by me completely ignoring me. Zero customer service! Can't wait for Uniqlo to open its stores! had a great experience at their location overseas. Superior products too! Shopping at local Hollister store has been very pleasant!"|1
3 years ago|Ankit Bhutani|The cashiers are very bad. One cashier was out of receipt paper, she kept us waiting for 10 mins while she helped other customers from behind on a different register. Very very bad unpleasant experience. Would not recommend this store. No doubt they are going out of business.  Update 1: Then 20 mins later. Still no receipt. Cashier does not know how to print the receipt or cancel the transaction. Still waiting at the cash register for someone to help.  Feels like i am trapped here. They can’t print the receipt or cancel the transaction. Pathetic!  Update 2: after 10 more mins, the cashier disappeared and we are still waiting like objects which don’t exist.|1
5 years ago|Yahel J|Bought a dress shirt in Seattle which was sold to me WITHOUT the tag, I was assured it was fine and I'd be okay to return it if needed. I came by this location today to return the shirt because it gets very easily wrinkly in the bag despite being 'easy-iron'. They refused to return the item because there was no tag on it, even though I was told this would not be an issue... Manager said since she cannot resell, she will not refund. This is unacceptable and I plan on escalating it. Needless to say I will not shop here again...|1
4 years ago|Laurencefg|Very MAD! I came all the way to shop at H&M on my night off, spent an hour meticulously looking every item through every section, looking for my size for each of the many items I wanted to try on. At the fitting room I took 7 in and they told me they’d old on to the rest (about 12 items left) and when I came out to try the rest IT WAS ALL GONE! I didn’t even get to try on half of what I had meticulously picked out and looked for my size, face in the racks to reach (I’m short...) .... instead of the relaxing evening I had planned shopping, I came out of there completely MAD , the girls working the cabins barely apologized... at least if they had showed me how sorry they are , I would have felt taking cared of as a customer... but they just stared at me blankly ... Thanks for ruining my shopping evening...|1
3 years ago|Layla Cowley|Went into this store to exchange/refund a garment that I had bought a few weeks back, but wasn't able to due to by own negligence of losing the receipt. I don't have the lady's name that was at the counter but she must be a manager or supervisor, . After my quite passive aggressive encounter with her about my garment, another (male) H&M employee came up to the counter to ask her to search a garment for a lady he was helping, to see if it was in stock in another size. She said that she wasn't able to do that as they don't have the ability to do that on their system (which I believe is not true) and told the lady to download their new app to check the store inventory on her phone. Now I'm all for apps and new technology but this was a lady who was probably in her late 50s and she didn't want to download the app - fair enough, I'm in my early 30s and I wouldn't want to stand around downloading an app either. The young male employee that was helping this lady suggested that he could use the app on his smart phone to check - YAY A SOLUTION! But no, the woman who had been passive aggressive with me, told him under no circumstances was he to have his phone on the floor and to put his phone away. She then told the woman to head downstairs as the system down there could check the store inventory (huh?!?!)  I would just like to say well done to the young male employee who took out his phone to help the lady, it's not like we're living 20 years ago - everyone has their phones on them at all times now H&M, as long as your employees aren't stood around on the floor instagramming and taking selfies I really think they should be using their personal devices to assist with shoppers questions.  I shop here quite a bit - but I will definitely chose to go to another checkout should this woman be on the desk in future!|1
4 years ago|E C|The renovations is taking a long time. It has been over 1 year. No escalator, forced to use stairs. Store is a mess with reduced selection. Why don't they just close the store and finish renovations quickly, then reopen. Don't make people shop in a construction mess.|1
8 years ago|Madison Strub|"I would like to warn anyone who intends on trying anything on at this location. Not only do they talk about how they hate their jobs and ""running for sizes"", they are unfriendly to customers giving them shorts answers and honestly just be impolite. Not to mention they constantly grab things from you when you don't want them  I thought it was maybe just a one time thing, talked to the manager, but when I went back the same thing happened again. Both times I have left extremely upset. And on top of that, I actually buy clothes to try them on at home in order to avoid going back into the fitting room."|1
5 years ago|Fawad Hassan|The staff is very rude and probably the worst experience I’ve had in any retail store. I happen to be walking by the store and liked something so I thought I’d go in. The cashier refused to scan the item and confirm that the item was on sale. When I asked for the manager, another employee suggested that this guy was new and I should give him a break and that I was right and the item was on sale. When we got to the cash register again to buy the item the guy threw the item towards me and walked away. It just shows that these guys aren’t trained for their job and probably should not be working retail. There are plenty of other people that would happily take the job and be miles better than the employees they have working right now. I would not go back to H&M again. A big no from me. Also, they should probably provide their employees with name tags so I could write that guys name on here.|1
3 years ago|M & K|Ever since they started with their renos this location has been difficult to shop in. Now they've put in the escalators but there are only fitting rooms on the second floor so it makes it difficult to get sizes, etc. or to carry more than a few things up. I was there this last Thursday and when I asked if someone could check if they had a size the associate rolled her eyes at me. When I got out of the fitting room, I found out that the items that I had put aside with the same girl (that I had picked out as a gift for someone else and was not trying on), had been put back. I didn't have the energy to bother buying anything at that point and probably won't return.|1
4 years ago|Melissa Gibbons|"Very disappointing costumer experience, and I have been a number one fan of h&m for years, NOT ANYMORE. They have this posters saying ""buy it now, decide at home..."" and that's what I did, It was my birthday last week so I bought a bunch of stuff and decided to try at home, to see what outfit I could wear and what to keep and what not. I'm the type of person who also, ALWAYS saves every little receipt, no matter how insignificant it is. Weirdly somehow, they through the receipt on the bag, went home never found it again. I've been looking everywhere for my receipt so I can return ONE THING of the bunch of stuff that  bought. I didn't like the item, how it fit, the color, the size. Anyways, went there explained the situation, they said they couldn't do anything. So I was like ok so that ""BUY NOW, DECIDE LATER"" thing will not count? . NO because you don't have a receipt. Yes I know, I'm sorry but this is a brand new Item, right out of the fabric, new collection and everything, In perfect condition, I tried it once! no no no way. so I went on the website, and I saw that YES YOU CAN RETURN YOUR THINGS AS LONG AS THEY ARE IN GOOD CONDITION, and tried to go back and showed on the screen of my phone.. and they said ""that's not in Canada"". Thank you H&M for making my ""BUY NOW DECIDE LATER"" decision totally on the wrong side, making me regret it. and LOST a BIG COSTUMER, who used to buy every single piece of clothing in H&M. NEVER AGAIN. Also, the cashie suggested that I talked to the manager, and the MANAGER WAS VERY RUDE. Managers are suppose to try and help you, HE WAS COCKY, COLD AND RUDE."|1
3 years ago|Jessica|I asked a girl in the fitting room for a pair of joggers in XS in any color, and she comes back saying they don't have XS in black.  I then reiterated that I would like to try on the joggers in any color that's an XS, and she snarled at me and took off.  To make things worst, I went to pick up two shirts that were left with her before I went into the room, and they were nowhere to be found.  It was the only sizes left in the shirts.  She didn't even look for it when it was clearly her mistake for misplacing it.  I couldn't believe how rude and condescending that encounter was.  Sorry, but I'll spend my money elsewhere now.|1
6 years ago|Alysia Lynn|I wonder if H&M HQ realizes how much money they are loosing on long fitting room and till lines.  At least on three occasions I've attempted to shop here and left after standing in line for too long.  Your cheep cloths are not worth it.... sorry.|1

3 years ago|D Z|"It's busy, under construction and the worst part is that the change rooms/fitting rooms are closed off by curtains with no indication for the workers to know which rooms are empty - so the workers keep literally ""peeping"" into your room to see if it's in use. They peeked in on me at least three times while I was changing. I won't be going back to this location."|1

We emailed H&M and they said to do a refund. And I didn’t understand why they couldn’t just ship the missing item.. So then she went to this location and was only exchanging a size and the sales associate was unprofessional, rude and disrespectful. Not only that but they had made the mistake of refunding the items she wanted to EXCHANGE. Not return. They refunded the items and said that there was nothing they could do about it. Overall we both had terrible experiences online and in store. Both situations were not our fault and they did nothing to help. Along with the fact that the sales associates handled it rudely.|1

Go downstairs and ask someone there.', and then, when I was trying some jacket on, she came to me, and said with an annoyed face, 'You shouldn't be trying these things on cause they are on sale.', and there was no notification or sign that we cannot try sale times on. Hey, if look at this review, you know, next time, try to talk more nicely to the customers cause they will understand you or I think you shouldn't be working in customer service.|2

Staff are rude, make you wait while they are talking to other staff, no one says hi and it appears some staff don't even want to be there. I've stopped shopping there because it's a negative environment.|2
5 years ago|Robby Hlady|I'm not a big fan of crazy busy places, or shopping. If you don't like to shop I wouldn't recommend this place. The clothes are definitely more for millennials than someone whom is almost 40. However, if you're on a tight budget, and you like the fashion these days, I'm sure you'd like it here. Oh, and they don't really cater to heavier set people very well.|2
3 years ago|Tanya Kucey|What the heck happened to this place?!  and I'm not talking about the renovations which could easily make you feel like you're in one of those escape room mazes, I'm talking about the staff and the lack of training / guidance and general giving a hoot about their job.  Very poorly managed dressing room because the kids working it (no one was over 20) are more interested in talking to each other or being on their phones than actually helping the people in line.  There was at least five people in line and there were over 15, yes that's right FIFTEEN, open fitting rooms. I counted. and there was for counter staff just standing around talking about music on their playlist.  I was going to try and have a discussion with the manager of the store, but she was magically unavailable. (AKA did not want to deal)  This used to be a favourite stop and browse place for me when visiting town but not anymore thanks.|2

5 years ago|Terence Yee|"Review based on my experience shopping men's section on two.  For fast fashion shoppers, have at it—inexpensive, cheap, and trendy. This Downtown Vancouver location can be considered a flagship. When H&M launches their annual designer collaboration this store gets the most stock and sizes. The same can be said about their minor collaborations (e.g., David Beckham; the Weeknd).  The only lines worth considering are their Studio, Trend, and Premium. They're made with better quality, better fabrics, and are more stylish than their regular H&M offering.  From my experience, staff at this location can be rude and ignorant of what goes on. The few times I had questions I was met with ""I don't know"" and a shrug. Employees keeping the store clean tend to be the rudest, for good reason: the store layout is tightly cramped and poorly merchandised. Racks are overstocked, sloppy and unappealing, and the typical H&M customer contributes to the mess. In short, self-serve and expect no real service."|2

8 months ago|Steffany K|"I normally have a good experience at this location, but yesterday was far from pleasant. I was returning a shirt and asked if they could check another store for a smaller size of something else. As I looked for the receipt the girl told me ""I can't return it without the receipt"", after I had just finished telling her I need to find it.. She looked at me impatiently, and the male clerk called to check the other item for me. They told me to stand to the side and he served other customers as he called 2 other locations (meanwhile acting massively annoyed). He proceeded to yell through the plastic window covering, ""do you want the Small on hold, I need to tell them now otherwise I can't do it"". He was asking if I wanted to hold a Small, when I had asked for an XS. He kept getting aggravated with me and making me stressed out and acting like it was a large inconvenience to make a small request. Let's just say, I'm never going to ask for anything there again - at least not to those two people.I left super stressed and embarrassed from the whole thing. Plus a couple customers looked at me annoyed as he served them and yelled at me at the same time. The three stars are for the two nice people who helped me put something on hold earlier in the day. I get we're living in slightly strange times, but no need to treat people like that. If you don't like your job, it's not our fault."|3

2 years ago|Mehryar Yeganeh|The location is not good to take your car especially at rush hours, that’s so difficult to find a parking lot. Although the staff are polite, you can’t find them in the store!!! Also, I bought an overcoat there that it was forgotten to remove its security tag. Be careful about it, it happened several times. The store is nice and big enough to get satisfy with up to date deals.|3
3 years ago|Savannah Rose|The new location is really nice, they have better size runs but the staff is just horrible. Can't run the change rooms to save their lives and seem to be overwhelmed with the smallest task.  Don't even think about asking them for a size because it's not coming. The cashiers on the other hand are lovely.|3
2 years ago|Mark K|Newly refurbished Pacific Centre location. My first visit since their reopening and the new look is really sharp. Very bright and welcoming.  That's the positive part of my impression.  But my opinion of the merchandise - in men's only, as I didn't look at other departments was a little disappointing. They have all their staples in stock like the t-shirts and long sleeve dress shirts which was great...and in ALL SIZES which was a first for me. (KEEP DOING THAT, K?) But that's kind of where ended for me So much of the other merchandise was really.....boring. plain. Or unusual styles and not good unusual. As I was shopping with a buddy on this trip we both felt like H&M is almost styling themselves to be a new LeChateau...and look how that worked out. They've changed direction a bit and in the process have lost some of the essence of what made them successful . I'm not sure if they know who their customer is at the moment. BUT, This is just one small moment in time with a lot happening to make operating a business incredibly difficult. So I will keep an open mind, let this slide and chalk it up to Covid and major renos throwing a curveball. It's ok to make a mistake. So I guess time will tell over the next few seasons.|3
3 years ago|fourest|great selection and i’ve been loving the fall selection! but unfortunately the change room staff are just god awful and really affected my experience here. super unhelpful and just loudly talk amongst themselves even when customers are present! very unprofessional! barely even got eye contact when i approached the change room counter. despite this however the cashier staff are great and super friendly!|3
5 years ago|Kristie Keeney|This place is really crowded and the lighting in the dressing rooms is horrible. However, they have a great selection, including maternity and children's clothes. They also have a textile recycling drop box, where you get a $10 voucher towards your next visit.|3
4 years ago|Jeff Feng|Layout is poor and some of the stock for male clothing is lacking and not taken care of properly. It is H&M so I was not expecting much. The redeeming part is the sales and promotion, you can get some decent clothing for REALLY REALLY low prices.|3

a year ago|Mia|It’s a spacious store with lots of clothing options, and great changing rooms with nice light and mirrors. There is no line ups to change because they have so many change rooms available. Only downside is although there is a lot of clothing in the store, I found there wasn’t a lot of sizing options when it came to pants. I also found parking to be a bit tricky, but that’s more to do with Vancouver.|4
a year ago|raspberryplatypus|I like how they are starting to carry a wider variety of sizes but it's only for a few items and most are not in store. I would go here more often if they had a plus size section or more extended sizes in store (including different body types not just plus size)|4

5 years ago|Eduardo Vega|Really cheap clothing. Staff are friendly and helpful.  If you're on the thin side, they've got really good options for men. Men's tends to be more expensive than women's, but it's still a steal.  I always come back for basic wardrobe staples.|4
2 years ago|Giang Dao|H&M reopened 2 weeks ago. But there's an unwritten rule about trying your jacket or coat on: you cannot put the clothes back on the rack due to fear of Covid-19. So don't try your clothes, buy it & try it at home & if they don't fit then return them. H&M will put these clothes away for 24 hrs before putting them back on the racks.|4

2 months ago|Louise Boilevin|Great , i  enjoy the place  and this location here at PC MALL.   Its huge it has 3 lavels.   selection is good . Went shopping on boxing day late afternoon  thanks to gift card  .  H&M reminds me of a mix of  old navy meets shein lol.   Staff are helpful and nice . It was hectic on boxing day  crowds everywhere  .  This location does have plus size clothing  up to a XXL & 18 size..... yeah it could  be better selection  for plus size like higher sizes and quantity but better then nothing.  They have tons of  XS & S  sizes and anywere else in between with good  verity .  Got a  kids section .   Its got lots of  other stuff like jewelry and phone cases, etc .    Tons of clothes etc for whatever the occasions and reasons  of wearing  .  Its next to public transportation this store  location  at this mall  and central DT location too .  The prices are reasonable probably the most affordable place in this entire mall for every budget  ❤|5
3 months ago|D K|It's a great place, it's definitely budget friendly. Some things are a bit more pricey. But you get good quality for the most part. The fit and finish is usually good. We love going there for fun clothes. Definitely worth checking out|5
2 months ago|Abel da Fonseca|Found exactly what I was looking for, at a good price. If you have the app, you can get some discount - which is always worth getting. Staff helped me set up the app, so I could take advantage of the discount ...... now that's looking out for the best interest of your customer.|5

3 years ago|Alex Hoang|"My friend and I went there yesterday, and an employee named Sam at the store was really helpful. My friend had a ""brilliant"" idea of paying for her stuff in coins. It was full of 5, 10, 25 cent coins. I felt really bad that Sam had to count them all, but he kept on saying it's okay/don't worry with a smile on his face. Wherever you are, Sam, you're the MVP of the week. We'll never forget your good deeds from that day, and I hope that your manager read this (because you deserve a pat in the back)."|5

a year ago|Komal preet|Last week, their employee named AVNEET was super friendly and nice to help me find a jacket size - in stock & on the floor, that I desperately needed. She went to each and every section of the store Her customer service was by - far the best that I've seen (or even expected) in any H&M locations I've been to.  She went above & beyond to help me out and that made my day.  I really hope her management sees this because she definitely deserves a pat in the back and possibly a raise :)|5
a year ago|Marie V. Cruz|I have been shopping at H&M Granville since coming to Vancouver a few years ago and have always been happy with my purchases and all the employees for the help they give me. Today, my purchases were cashed out by Avneet. Apparently, she is a new employee -- it's her first day working after her training! She is already such a pro! Very professional; informative and an affable young woman! Congratulations on hiring another great person to represent your company!|5

3 years ago|Arun & Jayati Singh|I like this place. It is affordable and the staff help out with a smile. For the one at the Pacific Centre, the renovations are still on. The fitting rooms are upstairs so one has to climb stairs to get to them. A tad inconvenient I think. However, the options are huge and the variety makes it worth it. I am not sure how someone with physical challenges can manage this. Work in progress I guess. Check out the summer clothes. Love the shorts and tops.😀|5
