a month ago|Mel R|Lifts poorly located in the far corner. Kids dept was far at the top level which should be located more conveniently. Staff at the till in ladieswear were unfriendly and unhelpful. The 'SYSTEM' was giving a higher price than the label and the assistant said the label was wrong - well you were wrong as The Manager came to resolve! Basic Customer Service training needed. I didn't feel I was a valued customer. Then the Assistant couldn't help to get another item from the upper level, 'I can't leave the till blah blah blah' - think outside of the box! I had 3 children and your store layout is ridiculous. Your prices were not correct and items for the 3 for 2 promotion were wrongly placed which inconvenienced me and so I left them. 3 white tshirts for PE ¬£2.99 and the next size up ¬£9.99 which didnt make sense. Very very dissapointed as all sizes upto 14+ are ¬£2.99 online but the 3 for 2 and promo is not online! Waste of time! Staff should handle the situation better! I just want good service!|1
2 months ago|YX Z|I experienced racism! It's so bad.. The cashier asked to use self check service but didn't help me remove the security tag! When I came back home I found it still locked on my clothes.|1
3 months ago|RONY,S VLOG|Very Unprofessional staff.  Manager kitty was such a rude person. Her behaviour was very unprofessional. We brought something from the shop but forgot to take the tags off. Apparently had to come back for this. Member of staff checked everything and took it off. All of sudden another member of staff stopped us by the door and took the shopping away. Asked to go to till in a very rude way regardless listening to our statement. Even when we went to till she wasn‚Äôt interested to listen straight way called manager (kitty) and there started interesting part. She came up to us with very loud voice like we stole million pound. We been requesting again and again to go and talk to her staff who sorted things for us. She was almost screaming with us front of all other customers and everyone was looking at us. Tbh I felt so down. Anyway at the end she apologised to us and admitted her mistake. If management watching this review then,All I want from H&M is to train those unprofessional, overexcited and uncivilised staff like KITTY.|1
3 months ago|Priya Sweety|Unprofessional staff, not all of them but the guy at ladies fitting room is very arrogant and he thinks the customers are his workers. Very disrespectful. This happened on 5th nov at 18:30.|1
6 months ago|Ha Khuong|I bought 3 items at this store at around 8:30pm on 15 Aug but the staff just packed 2 items into the bag. I came back to ask for camera check but they promised to check in the next day then contact me via my phone number even it was the last day I stayed there. There's no response until now, I cannot come back there to check. Customer service here is poor.|1

8 months ago|Johan Harmse|They seem to have sacked 80% of their checkout staff and replaced them with ineffective self checkout terminals that most people seemingly can't operate.  I was queuing for about 20 minutes today with no movement before giving up and walking out.  It's as if they are trying to make the retail experience so unpleasant that we'd rather shop online to save ourselves the frustration ü§î|1
9 months ago|Mr Jason|Terrible customer service.  We struggled to self check and there was no one to assist us. After waiting over 5 minutes for assistance we had to go to try and find someone for help.  We couldn't find anyone on the floor.  Eventually a very rude person came to the till to take our money, no hello, no apology, nothing! Worst shopping experience ever.  I would not recommend this store and I will never use the company again. Appalling service and treatment!|1
9 months ago|Sumayya F|Customer service is appalling. I had questions about where the shoes were so I went up to a lady who I‚Äôm assuming was the manager (brunette, white) and she wagged her finger no at me and walked straight past me and I went up to another retail worker and she had a lot of attitude when I asked her. Disgusting|1
3 months ago|sadnoodle|One of their employees literally shoved me out of the way when I was looking for something and was very rude, you guys really need to sort your staff out|1
a year ago|W|Awful customers service. I was so chocked because the online customer service is really good. Team member at the cash desk were having personal conversation and laughing out loud between them while serving customers . A manager with long brown hair came to authorised a refund and gave attitude to the customer without even talking the her. What an awful experience to be given attitude by someone in charge in the store .Never ever again . I‚Äôll just keep buying on line. The perfect exemple showing why online business is taking over store‚Äôs business.|1
a year ago|Tania Ahmed|COMPLAINT:  About the staff members in H&M Westfield Stratford (). I asked the cashier () specifically to exchange an online item with an item in store, I left both items on the desk (making it even more obvious that I wanted an exchange) However she automatically returned it, and did nothing about it. I asked the manager, she was abrupt and did not resolve the issue instead was very blunt, that they can't do anything about it. They did  not listen, instead they were very rude. I went earlier that day, and asked the manager and he said it was perfectly fine as long as the items matched the same price It was really sad, the other manager was not sympathetic at all, when I kept telling her my situation about my family relative, she abruptly repeated 'we can't do anything about it'.|1
a year ago|Bryan Uk|Very rude staff! I had a very bad experience in this shop. I love H&M and I am a loyal customer but when the people who work treat you disrespectfully you are very sad after! I have never seen a shop with more ugly staff than this!|1
a year ago|WaveyJones|I was at the Stratford, Westfield branch of H&M and a few young staff members decided to follow me around the shop, they never asked if I needed help, but they were always behind me as if I was going to steal something. I would like this matter to be taken seriously, as this is very racist and prejudice. If this happens again I will take serious legal action and will raise awareness that H&M has staff members who have unconscious bias towards a specific demographic. If come back again and treated the same way I will report you to the Local Government Authority which owns the property. Please train your staff to avoid childishly following Black people, if they felt something was going to be stolen, they should have followed at a great distance so it won't ruin customer experience. I did not confront them about it as I did not want a commotion, but if I experience that treatment again I will make serious vocal complaint to media publications raising aware of the racism in H&M.|1
a year ago|Nishat Chowdhury|My mum was robbed at exactly 17:30 on the 4th of September in the Stratford branch, and the staff showed no compassion. They've done nothing to help. This store clearly isn't the safest place to be in.  Pickpocketing is one thing but robbery is another. Obviously the security aren't very useless. When my mum came home she was shivering; she had to walk because they took her phone and all her cards. She is diabetic and now she is scared to go out by herself. This is how HM treats their customers so poorly. My mum gave the full description of the culprit; it was a lady wearing the hijab but nothing has been done; instead the staff were showing attitude as if it was her fault she was robbed.|1
2 years ago|Irene Burmaka|Great products. Second h&m in one day with rude staff on the entrance. We are all under the pressure but there 8s no need to be rude. Just before that visited other shop from different brand with very nice and friendly people around. Please work with your staff.|1
a year ago|Rupert Dannreuther|Terrible customer service today. Staff leaving till seven when massive queue. Rude staff at till whispering behind customer back. Ignored by staff member who was in front of me in downstairs till. 13:33 store GB0911 sa 132231 no 9259|1
3 years ago|Marcelina Paulinska|Terrible experience. Not only H&M has terrible return policy where you can‚Äôt do straight forward  exchanges. I bought something online on Black Friday sale, size was too big so wanted to go for smaller size. Couldn‚Äôt get it for the same price as originally as you can‚Äôt exchange items. You need to return it and buy it again and of course price went back it original one. Then you go to store to return item and code that is on my label didn't work. Haven‚Äôt been offered any alternative solution or apology. I was just left with: ‚Äúoh, the code doesn‚Äôt work and you need to return it online‚Äù send off. Won‚Äôt be shopping at H&M again.  Fix your return policy and poor customer service!|1

3 years ago|Carlos Rubio|"Horrible and unhelpful staff in the fitting room area ar H&M Westfield Stratford. Two memvers of the staff today at 8.42pm, talking loudly about random conversations in front of me when I came to try some trousers. Then I noticed that I needed a size more and they said they are closing and I cannot come back with the other said, it wasn't even 8.45pm yet! The only thing they said when I mention that I only needed a size more was ""sorry about that.."". It was definitely the most unprofessional service I've seen in retail and will not come back to this shop at all. There are plenty of retailers and definitely providing a better customer service!"|1
5 years ago|Peter Shaw (Clips2Fix)|New store looks great. Staff are useless. After waiting 30 minutes in a queue, I tried to use my Westfield discount card. He denied it, called for a manager and waited 10 minutes and they didn't come. Paid full price and a young boy left the security tags on the clothes! (Kids wear department) need to make a trip back there tommorow now. Salesman is 138933. Ridiculous|1

4 years ago|neety shroff|This H&M hassomany choices and varietiesjuat that the guy who was handling the trial room was very impolite and rude. As me and my sister were planning to enter the trial room to try the dresses he stopped us saying we can‚Äôt go together which my sister did not understand what he was saying as other H&M stores always allows plus we had a baby. As she moved ahead he said ‚Äú do you understand what I am saying. Sorry what is this way of speaking with client asking do you understand.?  At this I was very surprised to his way of talking with the clients. Sorry to say but please train that guy how to speak with clients and to use polite terms and gentleness in speach than  trying to flaunt his style and rudeness. I lost the mood to even buy the clothes and I just tried them and hand it over to him. He needs to tone down his way of speaking. I don‚Äôt know his name but he was speaking Italian and had dreads Hair. I wanted to complain right away but was so annoyed and upset that I just walked out of the store.|1
4 years ago|Mariya Dimova|Hello, Yesterday at 4.15pm while I was looking at selling clothes, someone stole my wallet from my bag. I immediately noticed your security guard that were near the exit . He wasn‚Äôt helpful at all, just said‚Äù  What can I do?‚Äù. You should have cameras and view the recorded immediately because the thief was still in the shopping centre and even in your store to rob some of your other costumers.|1
4 years ago|Rania Rahman|Absolutely APPALLING customer service!!! Would never shop here again. This is the flagstore in London and was shocked to recieve such poor customer service by its sales assistant.  Waited in the queue for more than 20 minutes on the main floor with only 3 Sales Assistants on the till with over 20 customers waiting to be served.  When I eventually reached the top of the queue one the SA‚Äôs signed out leaving only 2 members of staff on the tills. What appealed to be a manager, mumbled over tanoy for other SA‚Äôs to come onto the tills, no one arrived, the music was also too loud. Waited a further 10 minutes to FINALLY be served with what was an insensitive and crass SA. When I complained to her she was unapologetic, inconsiderate and unconcerned with the fact that loyal customers had been waiting for more than 20/30mins.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this store in a million years. Its a shame as H&M clothes are lovely and as the flagship store that represents London/England it has been thoroughly let down by its lack of well trained curteous staff. P|1

a month ago|Lavender Courage|"I visited on the 24th and bought a few items. The store itself was clean and everything was easy to find. I went to pay in the men's section. I was third in line. A member of staff highly encouraged us to use the self-service rather than speak to a person, quickly explained the process, and said she'd get me a bag.  I scanned the first item, no luck, had to wait for the staff member. She's next to me, explaining to a man and woman how they're not using it right. It's at this point the staff member says, ""Let him do it. Men are better at it."" I was mortified. The staff member then has to stand and scan all my items for me as none of the barcodes work. She walks off as I pay and I am left waiting for a bag. I have to alert the cashier I originally wanted to buy from and they get me a bag instead. All three people could have been served by the cashier in half the time if this staff member had just left us alone.  Upon arriving home, I realize they haven't removed the security tags from two of my items. I now have to go back out (I'll be going to my local one in Norwich, not this one!!) and get the tags taken off before I can wear my purchase.  Awful service and I can't believe what was said by your staff."|2

They clothes are okay  but the nice ones are hidden so you have to spend a lot of time looking.|3
a year ago|Sibrega|Store it is impecable, although i wont give full stars as i think full experience isnt just about presentation of the store which was great, although girls at the cashier were chatting in between then and not paying attention to the customers, lady no did eye contact,, did not asked me for my customer account for point collection, i was basically doing the job for her. Not really nice, i believe this needa to be managed|3

I was waiting in the queue and the young lady at the till was taking forever like super forever. Then another young lady came over and opened up another till, she served me and the original till lady was still serving that same customer. So a nice touch there of customer service.|3
3 years ago|Ilya Belankins|I shop here often, quality is great and so is customer service except one aspect. Usually when I drop clothes off for a voucher I quickly get served and all is good. Today, during busy hours, when I went to drop clothes off for a voucher the staff were awkwardly aware of my presence. After waiting for 10mins I got someones attention and I was told I was supposed to get in the queue. Luckily I was given a voucher immediately due to the inconvenience which I appreciate. But next time staff should be more aware.|3
3 years ago|Wagwhat|Came here a few days ago and was bringing some clothes for my friend into her changing room. The lady behind the desk at the changing rooms had a bad attitude towards customers and wouldn‚Äôt let me go towards the changing room my friend was in and had a go at me for trying. I didn‚Äôt get her name but she has a strong foreign accent.  Other staff members were lovely but this one...  not so much.|3

5 years ago|A E|New store is a lot better, but the person who came up with the idea of those annoying curtains in the changing rooms is quite silly. 1) they don't fully close 2) the curtains are closed at times even if no ones inside 3) mirrors everywhere so a small gap is very exposing 4) the shop floor assistant opened the curtains on me while I was changing even though the curtains were fully shut. Just save customers the hassle and build standard lockable cubicles.|3

Store is pretty amazing carrying accessories, swimwear, lingerie, footwear, sports wear, children's wear, men's and even a small  home section. Staff on tills are friendly and really helpful with a query I had. Didn't have what I went in for (beauty item) but came out with other things I needed. Good overall store.|4

4 years ago|sonnie hutchins|I've shopped at H&M since the 90s and always return for the shopping experience of space, good floor visual merchandising and great products and good prices. However the last 2 visits have been disappointing with very ordinary stock and poorer quality fabrics and choices. It seems the company is hedging oooh the safe bet with nothing interesting or quirky in stock. So I'm not purchasing as there's nothing I can't get anywhere else at equally good prices. Pity really.|4
