0|@hm_custserv hi my order seems to be stuck awaiting dispatch, can you check please? 51800233200
5|@hm_custserv Hi guys, my partner took a return to the post office &amp; despite every effort the barcode would not scan - the only thing the guy cud do was accept the parcel as the address was clearly shown. We have the proof of posting but your system is not going to pick it up?
6|@hm @hm_custserv when my money will be refunded?  https://t.co/FunND2Pxlh
8|@hm_custserv your 'notify me' function isn't working by the way.  https://t.co/g83StJucbc

12|@hm_custserv yes i follow
14|@hm_custserv Hi, if I want to put multiple packages in one return package (through Evri), do I need to put multiple return labels on the parcel or just one?
20|@hm_custserv  I ordered a dress on Wednesday morning at about 6am for a party bearing in mind the 2-4days for delivery. It’s Saturday status says order packed. It’s Been so for the last 2days. I’ve constantly experienced this with H&amp;m and its so frustrating.
24|@hm_custserv ordered like two dresses a while ago for my birthday next week, and i haven't even had an email to say if they've been dispatched from warehouse 😭😭 need them for my birthday fr
26|@hm_custserv return Page is not working .  Location India  https://t.co/CWklqh6g7V
27|@hm_custserv Thanks, sent a DM
32|@hm_custserv Hi. I sent my order to the wrong address by mistake. Evri and you have sent me a confirmation of it being delivered but the new occupier says it was sent back - can you help find what's happening? Thanks.
35|@hm_custserv Hi  Escalating an issue with order. It’s been 12 days and my order has not reached me. Upon contacting customer care they have been dodging the request and keep asking me to wait for 48 hours This has been happening since the 27th.
36|@hm_custserv DM done
37|@hm @hm_custserv   my wishlist has suddenly vanished. It was there till yesterday and then last night all of a sudden it's gone.  One curates their wishlist so that they can get things slowly and now all of a sudden it's not there.  Help.
38|@hm_custserv Hiya, I returned an item to you Monday, they’re usually pretty swift with the return, however another payment from Klarna has gone out in that time &amp; no sign of you receiving the return. How much longer do I give it? Many thanks!
39|@hm_custserv an order made on 28th which said delivery within 2-4 days is still in your warehouse and hasn’t moved since 28th Feb 00:00. Can you please send me this parcel. Order 51773874070
43|@hm_custserv Yes, I think two more too 💖..!  Thanks for helping me decide..!
47|@hm_custserv  My order has still not been delivered.Your telephone customer services is poor &amp; asked me to wait 10 days before calling back to ask for refund. This is completely against the sales of goods act. The order was supposed to be delivered within 2-4 days it is now day 6
48|@hm_custserv I jus did. Thank you
51|@hm_custserv hi, any idea when this product will be available in NL again?  https://t.co/8oCleCSWgv
54|@hm_custserv my order is showing as delivered but photo shows it’s clearly not at my address and I haven’t signed for it. Hope can this be resolved please?? Order 51736693130
57|@hm_custserv ordered goods on Tuesday night and just checked my delivery status as I needed the items for tomorrow. Apparently they’re still in the warehouse and haven’t been dispatched. The order said delivery would be 2-4 days.
61|@hm_custserv @hm should I buy two more..? That's my only question 🤔😄💞💯  https://t.co/KGQZpdjV2O
62|@hm_custserv can anyone please respond to my DM?

67|@hm_custserv thx for luv I’m so excited 🥰🖤 proud to wear this beautiful shirt #Haiti 🇭🇹  https://t.co/fV0ZzJg1Ql
71|@hm_custserv Also zwei Shirts sind jetzt nicht einiges. Auch wenn in verschiedenen Farben verfügbar.  Will nur darauf hinweisen, dass nicht jede/r gern an der Bauchregion friert...
74|@hm_custserv despite repeated complaints no response from your side for poor amenities . Tell me please shall I escalate the matter to consumer court .
76|@hm_custserv my order hasn’t arrived 51763395560
79|@hm_custserv Hello! I ordered something on 27 Feb (UK) and it hasn’t been despatched yet. I go on holiday Tuesday 7th and have bikinis etc in the order. Can you let me know whether it’s likely my order will arrive in time? Otherwise I will need to source the items elsewhere.
80|@hm_custserv do you offer alternative delivery providers? Unfortunately for me I paid extra for 'next-day' delivery, but as it was shipped with #Evri 🚩 it hasn't arrived on time!
81|@hm_custserv hi, before I lug some carrier bags into town with me,  could you confirm that you're still doing the voucher for clothes to recycle? I can't find anything on the app.
87|@hm_custserv I have shared the details again in DM, kindly check.
90|@hm_custserv Yea, the same item was on the rack. Could’ve just switched it out. Also, it wasn’t pinned to the mannequin. I took my money elsewhere! Best Wishes! 🙂
92|@hm_custserv ☺️  https://t.co/VLtFevVpl8
94|@hm_custserv Encuentro Oceanía o parque vía Vallejo. Es que ninguna me aparece con la opción de recoger pedidos
95|@hm_custserv As I said, unable to DM you. Will drop an email.
97|@hm_custserv Not able to send a DM unfortunately. My order no. is 26715149952 (online from the app in India) in case that helps.
99|@hm_custserv I have been in touch with customer care since January 2023! We’re in March now!
100|@ToddAultIII @hm @hm_custserv  Nästa generations marknadsplats, kanske något för er att ta en titt på, även era outfits på avatarer?  https://t.co/pyxTK0kgfE
102|@hm_custserv Thx ☺️
104|@hm_custserv Hi I have messaged you
109|@hm @hm_custserv I was informed that I will get my refund on 26/1/23 but again unfortunately till today I don't get my refund. I have tried calling customer service so many times and every time I was informed to get my refund in one week and also my mail was not replied.
111|@hm @hm_custserv I have ordered from H&amp;M App on 1/1/23 and received it on 3/3/23 but unfortunately 2 of the 3 items are too big to wear so I register a return on 10/1/23.The items were picked up on 11/1/23.  Order number - 26439907472
112|@hm_custserv @hm_custserv  I was informed that I will get my refund on 26/1/23 but again unfortunately till today I don't get my refund. I have tried calling customer service so many times and every time I was informed to get my refund in one week and also my mail was not replied
115|@hm_custserv hi I’ve paid for next day delivery and had no updates from yourself or evri and no parcel arrive.
117|@hm_custserv hiya I’ve picked up and order and the wrong item has been sent. How do I return if I can’t select the item as it’s not in the order?
120|@hm_custserv All sorted now thank you x
124|@hm_custserv order number; 51758731970 ordered 2 days ago, says delivery in 2-4 days but still not been despatched?
126|@hm_custserv the app has kept crashing for the past couple of weeks, even after installing the most recent update, means I can’t browse new in for longer that 10-20 seconds as it dies every time 🙁
127|@hm_custserv when is the studio collection dropping online in Canada? Thanks
131|@hm_custserv hello, I ordered a cardy and paid next day delivery. Cost me £6 😫 but because you are too busy there’s a delay! Very disappointing. My daughter is going to an awards ceremony tonight and I now have to rush out to find a replacement! Not happy!
132|@hm_custserv Ya os lo he enviado por privado, dame una solucion.
133|@hm_custserv Hi h&amp;m. When is the Ramadan collection launching in the UK please
134|@hm_custserv Heb gister gedmed met een vraag over mijn retourzending, hoor graag reactie terug!
136|@hm_custserv South Africa
138|@hm_custserv çok sevdiğim bir markasınız, ürünleriniz çok güzel.. Ama Türkiye 'deki hizmetiniz ve müşteri hizmetleri servisimiz çok kötü :(
139|@hm_custserv hi ordered online clothes from monki can I still return instore ?
140|@hm_custserv just placed an order using my 15% H&amp;M Move discount code, but only 7.5% came off? Can you fix this?
144|@hm_custserv @hm_custserv can i know how to contact with your for own your brand store or we can say become a store member of your group because I didn’t find any useful things on the website
147|. @hm_custserv HM...(pun intended) 🙂 guess being a member is a privilege and will cost me more to buy clothes at @hmcanada 😄 made me laugh (in a good way lol) #shoppingonline  https://t.co/vxdtn0LkvA
151|@hm_custserv I’ve DMd you the details on Twitter.
157|@hm_custserv Ihr seid so klug. 🙄
159|@hm_custserv Thank you I will dm. I do realise it’s a first world problem and I’m off the ceiling now, it’s mainly the cheek of the delivery agent claiming to have attempted delivery when I know it is not the case! And it was time sensitive.
162|@hm_custserv Suelten una pista de la hora será a las 00:00 ?
165|@hm_custserv hi. I paid for next day delivery and your delivery partner (evri) has claimed to attempt delivery - they haven’t, it’s a fiction and tomorrow is too late. I’d like the delivery cost refunded please.
167|@hm_custserv worst placing order experience of all time. Can't update address. Some other address is picked instead of what is typed Zero logic applied in text box validations. Please consider hiring coders next and not models Ps: still struggling to change address &amp; place order.
170|@hm_custserv les hable
171|@hm_custserv sent you a DM
173|@hm_custserv La que me ha atendido no me ha dicho eso, me ha respondido otra cosa cuando le he preguntado. Y ha escrito mis datos en la copia que se quedan en caja de dicho cambio.
183|@hm_custserv @montsecbruguera Buenas noches me sigue apareciendo código rm1 y mi dinero se me desconto de mi banca ya son 3 comoras que me pasa lo mismo y nada que me dan una solución por qué quise aprovechar el descuento de aniversario y nada necesito una respuesta?
186|@hm_custserv Ok muchas gracias 😊
189|@hm_custserv You’ve cancelled my order without intimating me. What about my refund?  https://t.co/Bidf8oW5p2
191|@hm_custserv No sirven de nada sus respuestas y me queda claro que son una mas de todas las tiendas. Le robaron a mi señora dentro de la tienda y no hicieron nada. Robaron mas de 10 telefonos en un dia en la tienda y el que se hacer llamar jefe de tienda no hace nada. Muy bajo su tienda.
193|@hm_custserv Buenas tardes, pero si no es un pedido online puedo llevarlo a un punto Celeritas? No tengo formulario,lo compré en tienda
196|@hm_custserv hello, what I ordered is too small. But my package didn’t include a paid return label. How do I get a return label please? Thank you!
197|@hm @hmindia @hm_custserv Providing false assurances to naive customers. It's been 10 days and I am still waiting for someone to contact me for my refund. Over and above that they say that refund has been processed. Then where is it? Stop looting a common man!  https://t.co/GvfaOeMQzS
200|@hm_custserv Hello! Can you tell me whether an item is out of stock for good? I want to sign up for notifications for item 1040459008 - Specifically the dark purple oversized flannel. But everything with that number is completely out of stock, so does that mean it’s gone forever?
202|@hm_custserv Thanks for responding. I spoke to someone this morning and it has all been sorted.
206|@hm_custserv Nope! Tried that too. Still crashing but only on the new arrivals section
208|@hm_custserv @talialane96 Also happening to me! Can’t get through  the new arrivals without it crashing. iOS and app are both up to date
214|@hm_custserv I took a bag of clothes to donate yesterday to the Lakeside branch and a worker there told me it needed to be bigger! I was taken aback and am disappointed to be told my donation is not good enough
215|@hm_custserv hi i ordered something yesterday but the order hasn’t actually gone through and my moneys been taken?
217|@hm_custserv Hoi mijn bestelling is 21 februari verzonden maar nog steeds niet geleverd en staat op verwerkt?
219|@hmindia @hm_custserv Guys ive been trying to place an order for a long time. I contacted your customer care but they were not helpful. PFA the error which is not allowing me to proceed further. I did try to enter different addresses but no use, is the problem specific to Kerala?  https://t.co/1fnHjpGB3L

265|@hm_custserv can I ask why you app is soooo glitchy at the moment? Seems to have been an issue since you added all the other brands on to the site.  A lot of my friends are getting the same issue where the app closes down when looking at new in
266|@hm_custserv Thank you. Sent a DM
270|@hm_custserv Hi. I returned a few items to my local store yesterday but the refunds aren’t reflecting on my @klarna app yet. Please can someone get in contact with me? I have the returns receipts as evidence
274|@hm_custserv Thanks I’ve sent this info
275|@hm_custserv Hello, it has been 25 days since my order was returned and i have still not received my refund!
277|@hm_custserv Sure
281|@hm_custserv  hey can you tell me when will the product 1067430019 be restocked in india.
283|@hm_custserv Gönderdim aşkitom ♥️
286|@hm_custserv Your chat option isn’t working as I’ve told multiple times before. The order has still not even shipped.
293|@hm_custserv  I visited your store in Lexington, KY today to buy a blazer and pants. When I got home this afternoon, I noticed that the cashier left the security device on the blazer. I live 150 miles from the nearest @hm store. Called cust serv. Told me to go back to the store.
294|@hm_custserv I've just taken the tags off a brand new sleepsuit, the second in a two pack and found it has a hole in it. Can I return just the one with the hole that hasnt been worn? The other one has been worn and washed and is fine.
299|@hm_custserv If I have taken the tags out of a recent order that I've made can I return it or am I out of luck?
300|@hm_custserv Have done

318|@hm_custserv @amirah_a1 Hi, I bought items in the shop, lost the receipt (or was not given one, not sure), and I need it. I paid with credit card. Can you reproduce the receipt please?
319|@hm_custserv apparently you are only able to take cash at the minute and not issue refunds for the whole of the UK. Can you tweet when the system is up and running please save me travelling to the store again
322|@hm_custserv can u reply to my dm please
324|@hm_custserv I don’t have a store near me, it’s shut down…
326|@hm_custserv Hi. I purchased an item in Glasgow and need to return it (I have the receipt). I live in England and don’t have a H&amp;M store anywhere near me. Is there a way I can do this by post? Thanks!
327|@hm_custserv Sorry HM I didn't mean to tag you this is just fir KLARNA. But look at the difference in customer care jeez Klarna needs to be shut down.
329|@hm_custserv Replied
331|@hm_custserv order ID 2‌717‌431‌413‌2. I am yet to receive the refund of one item out of two items returned.
334|@hm_custserv I’ve been trying your chat but your not always exits saying some issue occurred. Your chatbot sucks.  https://t.co/WlWnQVc6NY
336|@hm_custserv Twitter isn’t allowing me to send the DM. You’ve the order number and order date. You can check other details from backend. I’ve given you sufficient information. Something which has not been shipped for 4 days and where I live shouldn’t be an issue for you to ship.
339|@hm_custserv What do you want me to DM? The order number is already in the screenshot.
343|@hm_custserv I’m trying to generate a return and the online portal isn’t recognising my order number. Please can you assist?
345|@hm_custserv Even after inboxing alll details you guys are playing around since last one week..that shows your intention..Now I will go to store and get this resolved my own way..you guys should resign that you couldn't handle the situation in 10 days and not a single call I received from you
347|@hm_custserv placed order on 16th Feb, delivered to local shop for click and collect on 23rd Feb but still haven't received my Pin to collect it. Sent DM on 25th Feb and no reply. Won't be returning as a customer in the future. Shocking service in this day and age.
349|@hm_custserv No updates yet from your side
350|@hm_custserv 27327510352 please expedite this delivery
351|@hm_custserv I'm not able to track my order. Your app isn't working fine.
354|@hm_custserv how do I cancel order  quickly?  just ordered to wrong  address
357|@MarleeBoe @hm_custserv @hmnetherlands @c_en_a Blijkbaar niet, als het goed zou verkopen wel. Het is een beetjes lastig en ik snap je goed, maar ja, mijn winkel zou ik ook vullen met spullen die ik verkoop.
359|@hm_custserv hi, ik wil graag weten waarom mijn bestelling na eerst een bevestiging te hebben ontvangen, te hebben betaald, opeens wordt gecancelled? En ook graag wanneer ik mijn geld terug krijg?
361|@MarleeBoe @hm_custserv @hmnetherlands @c_en_a Het zal minder goed verkopen. Als het goed verkocht zal het wel gebleven zijn. Helaas degene die het graag in de winkel kopen.

416|@OfficialKiarna @hm_custserv Hi Kiarna, thank you for reaching out. The way our refund system works is the merchant first updates the invoice on their end, which then automatically updates on our side of things so in this case we kindly advise reaching out to H&amp;M again so they can action this correctly (1/2)
417|Evri collected my @hm_custserv return in January &amp; now @AskKlarna is saying H&amp;M haven’t reported it returned. I contacted H&amp;M and they said they can see Evri received it and have issued a refund, yet on Klarna I still owe the full amount. Can someone help with how to proceed?

446|@hm_custserv my wife ordered something from you that your site claims was shipped on 12/10. Can’t find a way to get through to a CSR. All your virtual assistant and site say is “package processed and waiting for DHL pickup.” It’s now 2/23. How do I get an actual person to help
447|@hm_custserv I ordered from you a week ago and it still doesn’t seem to have left the warehouse. What’s happening? As I need the items by Monday at the latest I assume it will be too late now.  https://t.co/VXLHOrQtYZ
448|@hm_custserv @FiorelaInes Felizmente hay cámaras y así se podrá llegar al fondo de todo eso.
450|@hm_custserv I got someone else’s package. I have all their personal information. I called your customer service and they refused to refund me the items I did not receive and asked me to return a package that’s not from my country and ask the post office to figure it out. Help !
453|@hm_custserv a couple of times in the last couple of wks when placing an order on the app, my mastetcard is not accepted. Really frustrating!
456|@hm_custserv I will send video. It was posted on YouTube.
