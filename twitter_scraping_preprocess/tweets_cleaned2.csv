twitter isn't allowing me to send the do. you've the order number and order date. you can check other details from backed. i've given you sufficient information. something which has not been shipped for 4 days and where i live shouldn't be an issue for you to ship.
what do you want me to do? the order number is already in the screenshot.
i'm trying to generate a return and the online portal isn't recognising my order number. please can you assist?
even after boxing all details you guns are playing around since last one week..that shows your intention..now i will go to store and get this resolved my own way..you guns should resign that you couldn't handle the situation in 10 days and not a single call i received from you
