"poor services....kindly either close your store at orbit mall, hyderbad or improve your services... shame"
i ordered a dress on wednesday morning at about am for a party bearing in mind the 2-days for delivery. it's saturday status says order packed. it's been so for the last days. i've constantly experienced this with h&m and its so frustration.
"his, i returned an item to you monday, they're usually pretty swift with the return, however another payment from klan has gone out in that time & no sign of you receiving the return. how much longer do i give it? many thanks!"
"yes, i think two more too ..! thanks for helping me decide..!"
"hi, any idea when this product will be available in nl again?"
the for lui i'm so excited proud to wear this beautiful shirt
despite repeated complaints no response from your side for poor amenities . tell me please shall i escapade the matter to consumer court .
"i have shared the details again in do, kindly check."
"yea, the same item was on the rack. could've just switched it out. also, it wasn't pinned to the mannequin. i took my money elsewhere! best wishes!"
"as i said, unable to do you. will drop an email."
not able to send a do unfortunately. my order no. is 26715149952 (online from the pp in india) in case that helps.
his i've picked up and order and the wrong item has been sent. how do i return if i can't select the item as it's not in the order?
"hello, i ordered a carry and paid next day delivery. cost me 6 but because you are too busy there's a delay! very disappointing. my daughter is going to an awards ceremony tonight and i now have to rush out to find a replacement! not happy!"
can i know how to contact with your for own your brand store or we can say become a store member of your group because i didn't find any useful things on the webster
.   hm...(put intended) guess being a member is a privilege and will cost me more to buy clothes at   made me laugh (in a good way ll)
worst placing order experience of all time. can't update address. some other address is picked instead of what is type zero logic applied in text box variations. please consider hiring covers next and not models is: still struggling to change address & place order.
"Good evening, the code my keeps appearing and my money has been deduced from my bank and there are already 3 comforts that the same thing happens to me and nothing that they give me a solution because I wanted to take advantage of the anniversary discount and nothing I need an answer?"
"Good afternoon, but if it is not an online order, can I take it to a celerity point? I don't have a form, I bought it in a store"
"hello, what i ordered is too small. but my package didn't include a paid return label. how do i get a return label please? thank you!"
providing false assurances to naive customers. it's been 10 days and i am still waiting for someone to contact me for my refund. over and above that they say that refund has been processes. then where is it? stop looting a common man!
i took a bag of clothes to donate yesterday to the lakeside branch and a worker there told me it needed to be bigger! i was taken aback and am disappointed to be told my donation is not good enough
thanks very much!

"It's true, it happened to me with a t-shirt too."
sorry hm i didn't mean to tag you this is just fir klan. but look at the difference in customer care been klan needs to be shut down.
i've been trying your chat but your not always exist saying some issue occurred. your charcot sucks.
"placed order on with feb, delivered to local shop for click and collect on word feb but still haven't received my pin to collect it. sent do on with feb and no reply. won't be returning as a customer in the future. shocking service in this day and age."
"apparently not, if it sold well it would. it's a bit difficult and I understand you well, but yes, I would also fill my store with stuff that I sell."
it will sell less well. if it cells well it will stay. unfortunately those who like to buy it in the store.
"hi there, i've sent you a do, are you able to look into this please? thank you"
followed washing/dwyer instructions and the jacket shrunk. not impressed
"hi, are you able to confirm if you've received my return please? cracking details say it's arrived with you but i haven't heard anything since. thanks in advance"
just curious to when the bugler cold is donna drop?
perfect thank you!
"the member says discount, can this be used more than once during the 4 days? for example if i place an order but then come restore tomorrow can i get 15% off again or not? x"
"perfect, thank you very much"
"hi diana, thank you for reaching out. the way our refund system works is the merchant first updated the voice on their end, which then automatically updated on our side of things so in this case we kindly advise reaching out to h&m again so they can action this correctly (1/2)"
"good morning, could someone get back to me regards the plus member discount for over 40, mine will not apply. thank you"
"excellent, thank you for the quick response"
Happily there are camera and so you can get to the bottom of all that.
Right now a truck arrives with dollars. On't worry.
