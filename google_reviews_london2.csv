a month ago|Vijay Verghis|Very bad customer service at this store in London. If you are not in a hurry go to the H&M store at Oxford street. The guys standing at the paying counter made us go back in the line after standing for 15 minutes for no reason. He just did not look at the line and moved us back. Customer Rep or sales guy name is talal. When we brought this issue up there was an Indian/pakistani guy who was super rude with us and told us you should just break the line. I would suggest visiting better stores around with better customer support. Pathetic after spending almost 150 pounds this was not worth the treatment.|1
2 months ago|Caoimhe Duffy|Terrible staff who were openly giving out about doing their jobs. No assistance with self-checkout. Didn‚Äôt see anywhere for tag removal and ended up leaving with tags on my items. Alarms went and the security guard just told us to head on. He didn‚Äôt think for a second that someone who has never done self -checkout for clothing may have left a tag on. Great stock but the staff are incompetent.|1
a year ago|Sheza Marinova|Really disappointed with my experience at this store today. I saw 3 very sad looking plants reduced at ¬£3 at the ‚Äúlast chance‚Äù section. I thought I‚Äôd save one and get a bargain at the same time. When I went at the till the manager rudely explained these were placed there by mistake and cost ¬£22 each. I find this extremely overpriced for a dying plant. And there was lot of other sad looking overpriced plants too. I would not recommend plant shopping from H&M.|1
4 months ago|R|I really love this shop so much however I went to return a bed set recently and was quite shocked at how rude the staff were. They said I couldn‚Äôt return it because it wasn‚Äôt in its packaging - she asked me I wanted to return it because it wasn‚Äôt the right size. I said no it didn‚Äôt suit my room and she continued to say ‚Äúyou should really know the size of your bed before you purchase‚Äù - first of all not what I said and second of all, SO rude? She then said I can exchange it‚Ä¶ why is it now acceptable for an exchange and not return?|1

8 months ago|m bellot|Had NOTHING instore worth buying. Looked on EVERY level from all around the shop floor- A waste of time. Ended up going to a completely different store where some nice items of clothing were purchased.|1
2 years ago|Patricia Liang|Dangerously overcrowded when I went there yesterday. H&M Home Store was packed and no one was following the one way system. Children running around. Staff and security guards did not social distance from customers. Store was packed with so much merchandise and it's not even possible to walk past someone without being face to face inches away. And can't order online since lotsa stuff are out of stock in the app or online. Disappointing shopping experience all round.|1

2 years ago|N G|Service in women's wear was good, staff were quite helpful, however the staff up in menswear were so rude and unhelpful. Service made me feel very uncomfortable and as though the staff were being forced to work. Really disappointing considering this is one od my favourite stores. Will not be coming to this branch again.|1
2 years ago|Amira|Very disappointed that H&M+ has been discontinued in store and is only available online!  This is pure discrimination to women size 18+ who will now not be able to shop at your stores at all.  Disgusting!|1

3 years ago|Florence BEN|My experience at Stratford shopping branch of H&M started fine on the day I shopped. However, I soon realised that one garment was scanned twice and when I went back into the store to rectify the mistake. The manager made me feel as if I was lying and she looked into my face and said let me check the CCTV. She came back without any apology just''sorry for keeping you waiting i will refund your money now. Is this the same treatment given to all customers? I will not be shopping in that branch again|1
3 years ago|Milda Ches|I used to love H&M and shopping online. But recently when I ordered a parcel, it was supposed to be delivered by company Yodel. It was terrible, they didn't deliver me anything, so I had to go all the way from London to Kent to take my parcel on my day off! I wasted whole day and money on the train tickets. Why this company even exists if I had to do their job? I mean, H&M was closer to me than the depot... I won't be shopping in H&M anymore until it doesn't work with this terrible company.|1

3 years ago|Erica BB|Poor and rude customer service from staff in the menswear department on floor 1 of the H&M clothes store on Regent Street. A lot of attitude shown to not only to myself but others who were being served in all three queues. How all three staff members got jobs in customer facing roles astounds me.|1
3 years ago|Gabi Goncalves|I was in the queue on 4th floor and there was 1 lady only in the cashier. I decided to try the cashier on 3rd floor, it was closed. On the 2nd, closed. So I went back to 4th. Still one lady and when a second one came the first one left. At least 8 people in the queue. It took longer for me to pay than to find and try it on the dress I wanted.|1

4 years ago|Aska Lemuralia|"Men's Department Let me quote my boyfriend: ""When you got 5 levels, you can shove the men in the basement in only one floor, in the dark"" The layout was a disaster, I think (as a woman) there should've been broader choices for smart/formal wear. But the worst part was the darkness and NO MIRRORS. The lights were so dim, I kept seeing dark green whenever something was actually a black piece of clothing. AND YES: - NO MIRRORS. NO ACTUAL MIRRORS. Whoever was the interior designer, should get fired. They decided the columns of the building should get covered in ""mirrors"". While this works relatively good in the upper levels, in the ladies section - bright, proper classic mirror ""coloured"" mirrors there-, underground this ""mirror"" is one of those dark-grey/black reflective surfaces WHICH ALREADY CAN'T REFLECT NOTHING BECAUSE OF THE POOR LIGHTING!! And besides - even if the lights were turned on properly (what's up, saving power? why not candlelight?...!) it still isn't a plain mirror, it is this dark tinted stuff! How the hell do you expect people to see if the blue matches your eyes? ... Shame that in a world-class shopping street such blasphemy exists from H+M!! *insert here GoT shame .gif* Good day!"|1

a year ago|Co Kehagias|Not enough for men|1
4 years ago|Bence Hajdu|1 star for unpleasant staff. Have been here 3 times in the run up for Christmas, and they may be overworked, but been always rude. An example being: there isn't a living soul at the tills in the men's department, so you go one floor up, where they tell you, that the men's are one floor down, but in the end they do the return just the same. Another example: you queue for the till to pay, where there are three cashiers in action, then after all the waiting the till gets closed by the shop assistant right in front of you, no explanations or apologies given. Guys, this is really poor, but you'll be happy: I'll spend my money elsewhere next time.|1

8 years ago|Anisa Elizabeth|"I went to buy a bag for my Mum (xmas present) 3 weeks ago. When I went to pay for it, the cashier lady who I think had a high status in the shop (manager or something) nodded to another worker next to her as if you say ""look at this teenage girl buying this womanly bag"".I was going to say something but I was in shock. I had done nothing yet encountered such rudeness from staff for no reason ! i just looked at them but they just carried on laughing and giving each other looks. I had been to the store a few times before but after that, i'll happily spend an extra minute to walk to another h&m. They aren't the only one."|2
3 years ago|M. Zz|Music in this shop is so loud I think the staff mistook it for a disco. Had a very hard time shopping with such loud noise in the background, couldn‚Äôt hear anything. If you‚Äôve got low noise tolerance or are on a spectrum best to avoid it.|2

4 years ago|The K D|Men‚Äôs department needs improving. Went to pick up a few cheap polo necks. Had to look hard through the rail to find one without a mark on it. Thought I‚Äôd found one, got to the counter to pay and guess what.....noticed a mark on the sleeve. Cashier also left a security tag on one item so the alarm went off at the door and I had to go back inside and have them remove it.  A big store with a decent selection of the usual H&M stuff but not a great experience.|2

Some of the staff are nice and some just can‚Äôt be bothered so they have their phone in their hand while you ask them stuff. Other than that, they open earlier on Sunday but you won‚Äôt be able to pay anything until 12pm due to their license. Don‚Äôt waste your time going around and ask to pay before 12pm they won‚Äôt do anything about it.|3
2 years ago|Guillemot|First time for me in this store, looks like they have similar good quality as Zara and mango talking about kids area, but the difference was in H&M the variety is mayor than Zara, because I find what I was looking for, after two days of searching, the only thing was my English is so bad for the employ√©s of the store, sorry, I'm not good speaker but I'm a good buyer, but anyway things happen, after hard and ugly day I was thinking in relax myself buying some things for my little kids. But my English was good enough. I recommend you ARKET my God what a beautiful things are here.|3

3 years ago|Alexis Nelson|I'm a fan of H&M generally but this one isn't the best laid out and in this case was all over the place in terms of customer service. It is pretty big but if you don't want to get side eye at the tills, think twice.|3
9 years ago|Katie Glass|This H&M is a bit of an odd one - they are obviously trying to appeal to more the more up-market client√®le of Regents Street, so stock more smarter pieces. Unfortunately, the quality is still H&M quality (i.e. not great), so they don't really pull it off. You won't find any super trendy pieces here, but it's okay for basics or accessories.|3

2 months ago|Vicky Thomas|Nice big shop, lots of clothing available. Went on self checkout, no issues.|4
a year ago|Sutapa B|One of the largest H&M Stores in London and perhaps the only one with the largest section dedicated to kidswear and maternity wear. I love buying children's clothes from here especially the colours for boys are so vibrant! Sleepwear used to be great too but, now the styles have become a bit boring! The reason for 4 stars is because this year the styles are quite dull and drab which could be due to post-lockdown effect, not sure, but pretty disappointing. The queue in the women's fitting room can get busy on the ground floor. The accessories section is good as well but not as good as the branch in Oxford street. Definitely a great place for kidswear. Hope they can bring back the great styles.....|4

11 months ago|Travel Reviewer|Huge branch located right next to Oxford Circus underground.  Loads of floors.  Generally well laid out.  Very nice and bright, welcoming.  Never 'looks' busy as it's so big and spacious.  Staff are pleasant.  I don't often shop at H&M but tend to browse now and again like I did today.  Cheap and quality is fine.  They have some nice things.  Would recommend.|4
a week ago|Jeniya Gwendu|Bought outfits from their sale selection|4
2 years ago|Gordon Warburton|Team are fantastic and the layout is easy to understand and find items you're looking for. Their selection is good, store is clean. Only downside is the amount of teams on tills, always one or two and always have to wait 10 mins to be served. Worth it though|4
4 years ago|Chris Ning|Big and spacious with a variety of clothes, shoes and accessories. Music playing and a few seating areas on second floor. :)|4
a year ago|Jeremy|Bright and spacious store with lots of stock! Didn't have xxl size in many mens basic joggers though - as stated on website!|4
3 years ago|AP AP|I come to this branch for the kids wear. It is usually organised and neat and I normally find great, stylish stuff for my little ones. This branch also has a home section with such lovely items. Staff are helpful and hard working and queues move quite quickly if they build up. This branch is located on regent Street which has some more expensive stores and so it's like a breath of fresh air having an H & M on that line up !|4
5 years ago|Diva L|Affordable fashion across clothing, lingerie, shoes and accessories. I particularly like this branch as it is  well stocked and surprisingly has ƒ∫ess footfall than you would expect given the location, doesn't get crowded out, though you can't say the same for the street outside, always super busy.|4
2 years ago|Debbie Walker|This is a great store over several floors right next to Oxford Circus. A bit hit and miss for the larger sizes but great product ranges.|4
6 years ago|Jack Bourne|Out of the 3 stores within walking distance this is the only one that has kids clothing.  Easy store to navigate around and prices are moderate. Quality of materials is excellent and the designs are inspiring.  Staff are helpful.|4
5 years ago|Alfred Sharp|I love their socks, but I wish they did then in a bigger size, they shrink after a couple washes. There was also a problem when purchasing the socks as the cashier didnt apply the 3 for 2 deal, but it's a great shop and ill be returning for more socks|4
2 years ago|Ahmed A|Nice little store with a wide range of clothing to choose from. It can get quite busy at times so I would recommend doing your shopping in the morning.|4
6 years ago|Charlie Anthony|Due to the size of the store and it nice staff you will not be disappointed.|4
9 years ago|Cassandra DenDanto|I'm from the States so we have a lot of H&Ms but these ones have so much more! They are massive and have so many clothes to choose from. I find that they have some different stuff here as well. I dont necessarily like to shop at places that i have at home but because this is so afffordable I figured why not look? I plan on doing a lot more shopping at H&M because I know that I wont be able to get some of the clothes over in the US.|4
8 years ago|Laura Porter|Popped in to check out the children's clothes in the sale this week and got some great bargains. The store was relatively tidy considering it was sale time and the prices were comparable with Primark - which is most people's 'go to' place for cheap fashion.|4
a year ago|patrick ring|Good quality denim shirts and jeans at a reasonable price, and the staff are really helpful.....|4
9 years ago|Paul Lynch|Just a stone's throw from their store on Oxford Circus, but this one is far superior. It is much bigger and consequently has a much better range of clothing. For guys ‚Äì look out for their collaborations with big name designers. Whilst the girls are queueing outside to get in, we can go straight upstairs and check out the men's section :)|4
9 years ago|Karin Harel|The H&m store is reat and have a very good quality. the childrens cloths are fantastic, very good quality and my children love it very much. there should be more sales prices and somethimes there are diffrences between the stores. the prices are usually ok. i had a problem with the service at the H & M store at the Oxford street. the appeal is not so good|4

Was even told by a staff in this store on the ground floor that it maybe out of stock but it would be on the 2nd floor if they had any left. Asked a really friendly Italian gent. Who not only knew what she wanted but where. Back on the ground floor near where the other staff member had been working. So thank you to him and your 4 is yours alone.

3 months ago|Bailey Baldwin|I shopped in the Regent Street H&M Home last night. I was a bit lost with where to find certain items I had seen online. I asked a sales associate for some help. I was looking for a certain candle which was not found in store. However, Rachel advised me that she would go downstairs and check the Stockroom to try and find these for me. as she was heading off the sales floor, another lady I believe to be the manager in charge asked where was she was going, Rachel replied ‚Äúto find some candles for this gentlemen, the Green dinner candles‚Äù of which the manager in my opinion wasn‚Äôt best pleased she was leaving the floor and simply said  ‚Äúerm may be‚Äù (kind of eye rolling) Anyway, Rachel found my products which were sold out online and not available on the shop-floor she gave me two of them as I requested which made me very happy. Rachel also helped me to find several other items within the store that I wasn‚Äôt able to. Rachel also served me at the till point making sure I knew about my H&M app and even showed me where I could save ¬£3 in vouchers that I didn‚Äôt know I had towards my sale. Honestly, it‚Äôs not mentioned enough when you get a good service in stores people tend to just focus on the negative. Rachel is a credit to that store and had she not of been there I would‚Äôve walked out empty-handed. She is a breath of fresh air in a very busy retail environment but she made time for me and made me feel I was a valued customer and friend. Well done Rachel!! I‚Äôll be back that‚Äôs for sure!!|5

Great staff, great products and even though I went in to get something small I didn't have to wait long in the queue. Brilliant!|5
a year ago|zena orala|I will be brief, I know what it is to work with the public and more in a store like H&M, and the other day I was amazed at the treatment of a portuguese girl, she was blonde, about 30-40 years old, she attended me with a sweetness and delicacy that reminded me why I work in what I work, I go many times, and I don't have a single complaint (maybe in the oxford circus if I would), but here I just say that all of you are wonderful, thank you portuguese girl, you are great.|5

2 years ago|CUDD LESS|This shop is observing social distancing beautifully. This allowed me to feel safe whilst shopping here. The store is located on Regents Street and has just reopened to the public.  I have often walked passed this site and could not wait until they opened so I could browse around the store and see the home furnishings they sold.  Wow, this shop is like walking into an Aladdin's cave of home furnishings. Once it draws you in you found yourself being wowed by the imaginative and beautiful way they display their goods. At times I felt I was walking into a royal kitchen (almost expecting a butler is be coming around the corner to ask what we are doing in this part of the house).  The store is over two floors and sells artistic but practical home items for most rooms around the house at astonishingly competitive prices.  I recommend this store for people who want to give their house of flat a tasteful but original touch. Out of you want to buy that special gift.|5
