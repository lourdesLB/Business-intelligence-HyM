Great selection and great service
"how on earth do you get in touch with an actual store! the ""Customer service"" line is far from customer service with an endless loop and voice that almost puts you to sleep with irrelevant information, despite dealing with frustration when you only want to speak with a human.
I cant understand why not providing store phone numbers needs to be kept secret. its not as if we can even order online in Australia.  Way to go H&M!"
"5 hours later and 2 emails I still havent progressed. I also rang the 1800 number, pressed 3 to speak to a customer service officer. I was promptly told the number I called was busy and cut off. This is Customer Service????"
"The dress I bought shrunk in a very unusual way and i have made 7 phone calls to date. I only getting message, '. . .busy call back later.' or I am just cut off,  and the service was closed till 6 January.  Bad, bad, bad"
this store is so cool its set out in a great way that you can see everything
