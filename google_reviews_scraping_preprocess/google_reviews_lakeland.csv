8 months ago|Bobbie Carden|I would not shop here. The commercial has the MOST Horrific looking outfits and the black haired women is so hard to look at...for goodness sakes please  do something with those  eyebrows. Just poor fashion and taste all around.|1
8 months ago|Javymar Urdaneta Martinez|I came to H&M Lakeland and it was the worst experience. The fitting rooms close 40 minutes before the clothing store closes. The customer service was terrible. And the teens that work there don’t have any customer service skills and have a terrible attitude. I came with my mom from out of the country and It was a Horrendous experience.|1
4 years ago|Jamie Watkins (RedWingJamie)|Basically, the mall is 2 steps away from closing. Nothing in it is worth anything. And unless you want Chinese food, there's not much to choose from to eat. There is now 5 Chinese fast food places in the food court, and that's about it. Go to Brandon, Tampa or Orlando. This place sucks.|1
5 years ago|Cooper Stevenson|This is my experience after trying to get in contact with the mall manager over several phone calls, none of which were answered or returned. I have sat in the mall management office for 10 minutes now with no offers for assistance. One of the employees looked at me through his door, then looked down and dramatically exhaled, clearly showing contempt for their customers. He closed the door, and I could hear what sounded like it couldn't be anything but a belt being fumbled with, and then a zipper. Some unnamed representative finally came up to speak with me, and she told me that performing permits aren't distributed, despite a security officer having told me they can be. I am not just fighting for myself, I want to get a shade put up over the bus benches so other people and I won't have to suffer, baking in the insane heat that Florida is famous for.|1
4 years ago|Maggie Skittles|I'm a fan of the FYE store and finally went around the entire mall recently with my service dog and my mum. The Dillard's is like something out of an early CSI (original) episode, kinda creepy, mysterious stains, and smells like dead something. The staff I encountered throughout the mall were really friendly and had great service dog etiquette. I was shocked to learn that they pretty much just let any dog inside because the owners didn't educate them about service dog laws (did a quick run down with a security guard and Claire's employee, misbehaving dogs, SD or not, can be asked to leave). After we grabbed a quick lunch at the food court, I was disgusted to spot my service dog investigating a bunch of bugs crawling across the floor. After that, we promptly left. I doubt we'll return. The staff we met were nice, polite, and helpful, but bugs around food is not okay.|1
5 years ago|Regina Wade|I purchased a bathing suit in Miami and tried to return it since I didn't use it but no one informed me of he no bottom return until I went to return it in Lakeland.  I just want to know why the hell would you return the top not the bottom that's a stupid policy.  People try on them bathing suits in the store but you all won't return them.  I will not purchase from here anymore due to that stupid policy and because when I purchased the bathing suit the policy should have been told to me and I wouldn't have purchased it I would have went elsewhere.  Never again.  Make sure this policy is told to your customers because I wouldn't have know until I purchased the bathing suit since the policy isn't posted up in the store but only on the back of the receipt.|1
2 years ago|George (Silly Barefooter)|(2019)  The locator thingy is in the wrong spot. Size wise it would be ideal for H & M to take over the Sears spot since Sears is finally closed but otherwise I'm leaving this a 4 star until it's moved to the exact location on this map. After that, I'll take my comment & rating down.  (NOTE: My rating doesn't reflect the store & employees so please check them out.) ________________________________________ (2020)  .... OK. I'm guessing the store owner must not had posted the location of the H&M cursor because my comment is a year old and it's still located on the wrong side of the map. Nothing has came to where the cursor is currently at and H&M is located near J.C.Penney.|1
4 years ago|chloe winslow|Extremely rude and loud employees, below average clothes that fit a minimal amount of people, and cheap and rough fabrics. the only good thing is the jeans but i’d say to order the online because the experience in stores are just awful|1

4 years ago|Darren The Inspiration|To start this off I would like to say I am a black man raising a beautiful young black boy. Growing up i was called monkey not because I was active but because the racial undertone of what it represent. I can give a short history lesson on how African Americans had to prove that we were actual humans and we were perceived to be equivalents to monkeys. They even put children in a zoo in cages throwing bananas at them,spitting, and throwing rocks at them while spitting racial slurs. For a company that big who has people  to research things like this should of caught this early because honestly this information and correlation isn't hard to find. So for the lack of care and respect for a specific racial demographic. This place will never get a penny from me. Not a good company for ne...|1

5 years ago|Mike L.|A lot of empty spaces. Poorly and sparsely placed directories. Nothing for kids to do. Stores are cool, but even they offer less selection than they use to.  Great please for senior walkers, very few customers in the way.  It's a shame. This place used to be a really cool place to shop.  Owners are doing another to prevent it's demise.|2
4 years ago|ladybugsiempre|Great location but... Another sad example of the failing of retail stores. Macy's was shut down. Burlington is sloppy & smells unclean. Much of the outside of the mall has a look of abandonment. If I could, I'd inject some life into this area with a couple beautiful dine in restaurants, some high end retail and a facelift to beautify the outside.|2
5 years ago|Jamie Garcia|Went to take my daughter homecoming dress shopping.  There were slim pickings for stores.  Everything in the mall is marked down for store closing.  You might be able to find a good deal.|2
5 years ago|Elizabeth Aguila|It's a good mall but in most of their stores tney need to keep it more clean and orginized, I know it's  not their fault that some costumers leave a mess but it still looks bad to not tidy up the place and lately  in most of their stores there is no cashier  or employee in sight to help out.|2
4 years ago|MaeZ Neely|There is not a good selection of stores in my opinion. There are also lots of empty spaces. I will stop in at times to visit one or two stores,  but gone are the says if spending a morning or a day shopping at this mall. The couple of stores that I visit are on one end of the mall. I can park on that end, visit the two stores, then leave. Some of the other stores that I usednto visit have moved across the street.|2
5 years ago|Mark Strizalkouski|It's a bummer because this mall does have so much potential with it's location right off 98, but this just feels like a dying mall.  There is an entire wing of the mall that is vacant, and then some of the stores I just can't imagine anyone actually visiting.  I would much rather go to Lakeside or travel to one of the outlets than visit this mall near my home.|2
5 years ago|Ray Wimberly|This mall has gone downhill over the years. It has the big chain stores that you'd expect, however all the good shops in between the big stores have abandoned and seems like a flea market with a JC Pennys and Macy's..etc.|2

6 years ago|AMamalala A|When you see how empty it is getting..... Take Note Don't scurry your customers away just so you can close on time.  How about actually staying open another hour or two so customers can finish shopping. Not everyone has banker hours and I am in line with plenty of other customers as we are being driven out of the  businesses.  I'm done spending my money where someone doesn't want my business.|2

5 years ago|Robert Cone|Like most malls, Lakeland Square is suffering from the lack of interest in brick and mortar shopping.  Macy's is of about middling quality.|3
10 months ago|Alexandra|I was looking for skirts and was disappointed they had almost nothing. The skirts they did have were like a wool material, hello this is Florida too hot to wear that. Also the quality of shoes was horrible and way overpriced.|3
6 years ago|Sarah Langevin-Gaspar|So many stores that were high quality have closed in this mall. Macy's is on its way out, and there are cheap shops like Nova that sell Chinese knock-off goods that might last a whole week. Save your money and go to a better mall. This one is good for Dillard's, and that's about it. Oh, and the food court does have some decent food.|3
4 years ago|Elle E|I used to love coming here when I was a teen but now it seems so weird and empty. There are more kiosks now than there were in past years but the larger stores have left. There are several empty stores and the mall isn't very busy. I believe they have made a lot of improvements in attempt to increase visitors, but I'm not sure it's enough.|3
3 years ago|ansyncom Ochoa|The lighting is too much, you feel like you are frying in there! They have good clothes offers but the last time I went I had to rush because I think the air conditioner wasn’t working|3
4 years ago|Chris Smith|This mall used to be full all the time but now its more or less a ghost town. While I did easily find what I was looking for here at Victoria's Secret there isn't much else left. I guess all the malls in America have more or less gone the way of the dodo.|3
5 years ago|Christopher Gutierrez|The mall feels very repetitive. Almost every store is similar to the other one next to it and the Theater is overpriced and has no arcade. The overall experience is pleasing if you're looking to just roam the mall but there wont be much to find.|3
6 years ago|Josh Prescott|For a while, this mall felt a bit run down. Recently, they have been trying to revitalize and refurbish things. There are still too many places to buy cell phone accessories, but it's getting better.|3
6 years ago|Camila Menendez|This mall is okay, I guess. Every time I go I try to get in and get out as soon as possible. The last time I went I saw a guy get tasered like 3 feet away from me. If you can go to any other mall I would recommend that you do, but if this is the only place close to you its not too bad they can definitely improve.|3
4 years ago|Michael Comins|Wow this mall has really gone down hill. There are so many closed stores. So I go to find Spencer's Gifts they had moved closer to the food court because the end of the mall they were at is now a ghost town. This is just a sign of the times it won't be long until they bulldoze this place to put in homes|3
5 years ago|Kojack1863 (Kojack)|Large indoor mall. Excellent for walking exercise. Has Sear's, Penny's, Burlington, and Dillard's as anchor stores. Has multiscreen movie theater but no inside mall entrance.Has decent food court but no sit down restaurant in the mall. Several restaurants outside on the road surrounding the mall. Mall is thirty years old but is in good condition.|3
7 years ago|Louis Sowa (JovialLouis)|There is a nice selection of anchor stores, but the smaller stores change way too often. The food court has a good enough selection.  I just wish the map on Google was better and kept up to date.|3
5 years ago|EJVJ “EJVJCJ” CJ|Nice Small Mall, my little one wanted to go on the trampolines, the guy working there obviously hated his job, didn’t speak to the kids or adults just mumbled and pointed, then spent his whole time on his phone while the children were jumping. Food court was clean and a nice choice of food.|3
9 years ago|Justyn Webb|It's fine but they have security that likes to get slick with. You. For example me and my brother road our skateboard there. They are. Allowed. Security trys to take it because she doesn't like skateboards.|3
4 years ago|Jade Montgomery|This mall used to be a very big deal when I was younger but it seems to be slowly dying. It's not as nice as it used to be, alot of stores are going out of business leaving empty spaces, not as clean. But it is a mall and still has decent stores available.|3
5 years ago|Steve Hoffman|Most of the good anchor stores have pulled out of this mall with JC Penny one of the few remaining. They built a nice theater a while back but the south side of the city is where the money is so LSM is just not the place to shop any more.|3
5 years ago|Jason English|The clientele here are fuggin garbage. There are some decent stores and a really nice theater. I recommend avoiding most stores if you can though. Unless you have a license to carry. Then you're good|3
5 years ago|Kebrina Tigner|"Over the years this mall has had a hard time keeping stores open here. We go when its a quick spur of the moment trip but when we're seeking an actual mall we unfortunately have to go elsewhere. Most of the more popular stores have moved around and taken up more of the spaces to make it seem ""fuller"" than it actually is. The food court options are pretty bleak. You have pizza, chinese, chik fila (if its not sunday) or more chinese."|3
5 years ago|Savika Mancini-Anmolsingh|Staff was great. I loved miss ann shes amazing. Freindly house keeper. Did everything i asked for everyday without hesitation. My husband is a truck driver and miss sara the manager allowed me to stay as lomg as i need until his trianer got there. Pet freindly hotle but gotta tell u. Rooms didnt smell like pets. We didnt hear and pets the whole 2weeks we were there. Prices are good. And the restaurant s are just a walk away. And 5 min from harrys new orleans style resturante. Omg you habe to try it. Anyhow hotle is between tampa and orlando. Safe neighborhood and respectful ppl in the area.|3
6 years ago|Amanda Gadden|Needs more stores. Dead mall at one end. But food court actually had good food. Mall was clean but I personally would like more decorations during the holidays. Kinda blah.|3
4 years ago|Robert Erb|Not a huge variety of stores and there are better malls if you drive a little farther (Orlando). Food court is great but lacks many great stores. Not crowded so if you are looking for a mall with few stores and a small crowd, this is for you.|3

4 years ago|Angela|Pros: Good variety of stores, family friendly, the movie theater is super nice and cheap Cons: People smoking right outside the entrance or vaping inside, needs healthier options in the food court|3
6 years ago|Tony merced|Everything is overpriced in mostly every store but I like to look around anyway I like the game attic store which has old school Nintendo video games and original Xbox video games I'm mad that they got rid of the pet store because i would always go in there everytime.I really wish it was a two story mall that has escalators so it could have a lot more stores that would be cool|3
4 years ago|Sharon Burress|A nice place for an air conditioned stroll around convenient shops and a tasty collection of fast food eateries in the food court. Best bourbon chicken in town at the Perry’s BBQ.|3
5 years ago|Shiva Ward|Decent mall but much like all others it's slowly dying. Could definitely be cleaner, but you can't expect much from a place on the decline. They still have a decent collection of stores though.|3
5 years ago|J H|A decent mall, but it is diminishing in the number of stores. The economy of the 1980's and 1990's has long since left Lakeland Square Mall in reminiscence of a time before the Internet. I will miss this place when it is gone.|3
5 years ago|Héctor León|Godd mall over all,  they need to take care of the entrance. You can have the best mall in side but if the building don't looks atractive from out side people don't gonna go to often.|3
4 years ago|Eric Wilson|The mall has gone downhill since the departure of several anchor stores. Penny's and Dillards are still there and remain the last of the big box clothing retailers in Lakeland. Sad knowing that Sears is on their way out along with Toys RUs.|3

5 years ago|Ellen Burt|Late version of the traditional mall with strong anchor stores. Modern design with short corridors which keep the tradition mall noises down. Adequate parking and access. Wanted a cup of coffee, alas it was not to be, all food related seemed to be only in a small out of the way food court. Other malls I enjoy have various food and beverage vendor dispersed amount the corridors. Nice mall but not worth going out of your way for.|4
5 years ago|Dale Manning|I like the renovations and new stores added to keep the mall relevant and a desired hangout location.|4
9 months ago|Faith Gendemeh|Good clothing and nice sales people clean store prices are are high could have been a little more organized|4
5 years ago|Jeff Goin|Overall it's a good experience, with most spaces filled. Dillards must not have long for this world given how run-down it has been allowed to get. Lots of choices in the food court, helping make this mall still a decent place to visit.|4
4 years ago|TM TM|It's still a nice mall despite the some stores that shut down here. They still got most chain retailers still open at the mall. They could consider a remodel in some areas like around the food court looked the same for years not much changes here. The least busiest part of the mall is where the former macy's was and between Dillard's and Sear's section seem to have more empty storefronts. Hopefully they'll be able to maintain it in the future if not it will end up like most malls around the country that are declining.|4
2 years ago|Aries Villanite|Probably the last mall Polk County will see if Eagle Ridge ever finally shuts down. The mall is kept up pretty well and seems to be doing pretty well in terms of success. Would probably give five stars if it was able to fill all of the storefronts with better stores.|4
3 years ago|Cassandra Goodrich|I'm not sure what is going on with this review but H&M is not Burlington, which are the pictures associated...besides that, H&M is typical. This is store is huge and clean. I wish they would carry plus size.|4
4 years ago|Heather Velarde|I would give it a 5 stars if there were to be a forever 21, Rue 21, and Justice, maybe a Gucci but it’s ok! And it’ll be better if the mall had better restaurants, like Subway (R.I.P) or cicis pizza, and a bigger and better place plays for the little ones will be cool too!  Love, local shopper 😌|4
4 years ago|Joe Schilling|Nice mall, not as busy as the Florida Mall in Orlando. Good selection of stores but looks to be in a build up of store fronts. Lots of jewelry kiosk with plated gold stuff and not a good selection of watches. Food court was nice. Wife went for pizza, me too but added a very expensive chicken grilled cheese sandwich, from some grilled cheese place. Really didn't go to shop, we wanted to get exercise and steps on or Fitbit.|4
4 years ago|Joe Radatz|I was shopping here while visiting family. Much busier than the local mall back home. Lots of shops. I could come here with the whole family and there would be something for everyone. Snagged some great deals at Burlington's.|4
5 years ago|Tweety Cat|I love the mall I just wish there was an arcade cause my friends and I always go there to hang out and we usually always do the same thing (shop and talk), but I think it would be cool if there was an arcade.|4
2 years ago|Timothy Harlow|A very quaint little shop to browse throughout. An over anxious crowd abound however, makes for shopping quite unsettling. Perhaps it was a little too close to end of quota sessions?|4
5 years ago|Cathie Cameron|It is a centralized  easy park,place to go.Good area typical movie house.Good popcorn and all the things  you do in-house  rather than  stream.Fun chance to see  movie when  it comes out and everyone is  talking about  it.Great family  place.|4
5 years ago|Nelson Martinez|I gave this mall four stars mostly because American malls are dying out and this one is still hanging in there. It is also one of those malls you DONT get trapped in bc it's too big or in the middle of no where. This one has easy access in and out and is surrounded by more stand alone shopping and restaurants and near a major highway.|4
6 years ago|Rebecca Garner|I really like this mall because it is quiet and have a good amount to offer. I wish they had more popular stores to choose from. Their food court is decent.|4
5 years ago|elexis Bryant|Best place to find authentic Jamaican food.(JERK CHICKEN EXPRESS) Offers big plates enough to feed two(if you get your plate made by the owner or lexi) and meals start off at 6.99 They have: Ox tail Brown stew chicken Goat and chicken  curry Jerk chicken And much more!|4
