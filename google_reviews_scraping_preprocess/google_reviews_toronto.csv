3 months ago|Annie L|I went in this evening to do a quick exchange around 7:00pm. I asked the cashier in the womens section (brown girl I think she’s Pakistani or something. She had the accent as well) where on the floor I can find the item I was trying to exchange. She literally rolled her eyes and told me “I don’t know go ask someone working in the fitting room.” I was in a rush and didn’t have the time to discuss this with the manager, but thankfully the sweet manager or assistant manager who was by the fitting room helped me with my item. She was a lovely lady and I wish they would train their employees to have this type of customer service. That’s all.|1
8 months ago|Ltlight|The Asian woman in the fitting room staff is quite odd. I understand if two people aren’t allowed in the same fitting stall, however, what I don’t get is why she only calls out certain people and not everyone else. If more than 1 person isn’t allowed in the stall stay consistent and say that to everyone who is doing it or just shut your mouth.|1

3 years ago|Jorge Coutino|Cashier was very rude and overall a disappointed experience. I hope someone can look into this and solve the problem. Here is the screenshot of the store where it happens and the information need it to see what sale representative assist me with my purchase.|1
8 months ago|Juanita Hardy|My dinner was good. But the service and service time was horrible. Maybe short staffed? But after we sat for our reservation, other tables started arriving around us, and they got service before us.... drinks and food orders.|1
a year ago|Anneka K|Horrible return policy. I went to exchange an item ordered online hoping to get store credit but I was told it was not possible. Employees were helpful and it’s not their fault but I do think that they should have a better return policy for online orders as it also costs $ to ship it back when most places don’t charge…|1
a year ago|Cong Huynh|Took my daughter out shopping after Boxing Day.  When has it become ok to charge a customer $0.10 for a bag? Maybe coming from the suburb I feel really offended?! I spent over $200, did they think that I should carry the clothes bagless? Does H&M believe that they can recuperate enough BAG money to cover for their losses in Asia?  Eventually my daughter will out grow H&M and I certainly expect that like Gap, H&M will be a distant memory. Good luck collecting 10 cents per bag because you definitely offended this customer.|1

10 months ago|Wainnie Gebrea|The  worst customer service, very arrogant while they serving talks about there personal life, i try to talk to the manager with my problems issues but i couldn't find 1 person to listen my concern. I ll never shops in that store.|1
a year ago|Md Khoir Ahmed|Very bad customer service. I have brought some clothes and security stopped me as claimed tag on the clothes did not remove. I showed her my receipt but she told me to go to cash counter agin. I went there and ask the cashier to remove the tag, she said there is no tag then I ask her to come with me to security girl or talk to ger that nothing wrong she said she can't leave that place nor talk to her. Then I asked to take the clothes and refund me as I don’t want to get bothered agin. It was very unprofessional customer service.|1
a year ago|Angus Wiebe|"They ran this marketing campaign saying take home to try on and return if they don't fit. Brought two pairs of pants home that didn't fit, try to return them and was told that they were ""worn"" and that ""we can't accept those for return"". Bait and switch marketing tricked me into 'buying' two pairs of pants that were too small. I had just signed up for the loyalty program as well, but now I won't ever be shopping at H&M again, which is a shame because I liked their products. But my hand is forced... would you put up with fraudulent marketing? I'll be convincing as many friends as possible of this as well, and contacting the BBB."|1
a year ago|Ethelia Choi|Very inconsistent return and exchange policy. I was told that I could exchange the products (socks on final sale) when I bought them. However, when I went to get them exchanged, the staff said I couldn’t. Staffs are very impolite and unhelpful. Bad experience. Would have given no stars if possible.|1
3 years ago|Joshua Andrew|Some friends and I spent about 2 hours in this store; not a single person greeted us on the sales floor, no one acknowledged us for several minutes when we walked into the fitting room even though there were 5 people chatting in there behind the table, and a pretentious guy working took a rail and walked it between my friend and I, forcing us to move out of the way, and he didn't even say excuse me or apologize for forcing us out of his way even though he had more than enough room to go around. The girl at cash was extremely friendly though (Alexa?), almost nice enough to make up for the mediocre service from everyone else working. I expected more from a flagship H&M location.|1
6 years ago|Lianne Joy Chung|"I should say customers shouldn't drop anything in the store!! One of the staff here is super rude with extremely bad attitude!! I almost felt like talking to the manager due to this experience. I see why people say that the H&M staff at Eaton Centre is horrible!! If I can give 0 star, I would....I would give the big store a 4 star, though... However, they really need to have a good team of staff working as well. Back to the experience.. First of all, I am pretty sure that the clothes were not balanced well. Just a little touch and everything fell down. I was shocked and couldn't react at that moment.. There was a nice customer who helped and at first I thought he was a staff, so I let him do his job.. then the ""real"" and rude staff come by to help and was so super rude!! Pin pointing that a customer who was standing right there dropped the clothes and still looking! I would have totally helped if there were only one staff!! But there were 3!!! Either way, that guy shouldn't treat a customer  who is right there with those rude comments. I will never come back to shop at this H&M as the respect we get here to shop is not worth spending!!!"|1
3 years ago|Neeti Chaubey|"Pathetic customer service skill by a store manager Andrea. I went to the store to redeem my birthday discount for 25%. At first she said i could only do that online, then i showed here where it clearly said i can also redeem that in store. When she was not able to scan the bar code due to some glitch on their end, instead of owning up and honoring the discount she exactly said these words ""well i don't run the app and you can come back later if u like"".not only it upset me but I was also sad to learn that People like her are running a brand like H&M"|1
a year ago|Sean-Anthony Ashman|Horrendous customer service. They advertise that they do curbside through Instacart yet the app itself is terrible and inaccurate. Called the store directly and was told they can work with me to buy what's in store through Instacart. I did research, made a list, called back and unfortunately got a different, terrible, lazy and obnoxious rep in the Men's department who didn't want to do a single thing to help... What else do you have to do during a shutdown? How is the messaging so inconsistent? Don't advertise curbside if you don't have it or you hire employees who would rather get paid to lie and be lazy instead of doing their actual job! Also once again...INSTACART IS TERRIBLE!|1
3 years ago|Harry Steinfield|This place is the worst. I was just shopping for 2 hours in the store and my shopping bag was gone seconds after I left it unattended. I told it to a customer service rep. By the look on her face, seemed like she was doing a huge favour to look for it in the fitting room and a cashier. When asked for a manager - she said it was only a customer who could take a shopping bag at this point. So I have one question: then why did the stuff look for it in the places like fitting room? I just felt very unwelcome and nothing was done to help me to recollect items missing either from a rep or from a manager. If only I was there for 15 mins I wouldn’t care that much..|1
3 years ago|Bionic Bunny|Honestly, I'm not sure how H&M survives. Really poor customer experience. $5 is charged to return on online item (very small print that I hadn't noticed before), no in-store returns, random cancellation of order when items that are in-stock then magically out-of-stock. Worst service.  Forgot about the terrible sizing, bad odour from clothing items, etc.|1
4 years ago|T and E H|"Horrible snobby sales associate, I ran into today. Not one smile on her face. She didn't even look at me. The total was $35.90, so I gave $40.90. She grabbed the $40 out of my hand so quick the change dropped on the security tag remover and it got stuck, the whole time she was huffing and puffing and rolling her eyes. So I said "" well you shouldn't have grabbed my money out of my hand so aggressively"" she then proceeded to throw my clothes in the bag, so I snatched it from her so fast she didn't know what happened. This isn't the first time. Terrible customer service. Half of these comments are about the customer service in a negative way... it should be a clue to the establishment."|1
2 years ago|Vivian Bloom|I haven’t went out to shop in a mall since quarantine started, so it was weird to see so many security guards which I didn’t mind. However, the moment I walked in, I saw the security guards running around as if they were chasing someone but they seemed lost. I ignored it and went on my merry way, at the time I was wearing a side tie top and it started getting loose so I found a mirror to retie it. And that’s when a security guard stood right beside me and stared at me the entire time I fixed my top. I asked if she needed something and she just ignored me and stared. I’ve never felt so uncomfortable at a mall in my life, horrible experience. Never going back|1

5 years ago|Stylez World|H & M  manager (a lady on Duty) in Sherway Garden Mall  was very rude in behaving with us as well as customer. When their Associate said that if we could find new sales item  they could exchange those items (even though final sale!) as we cordially requested for the exchange . We spent time to find out items but that sales associate  gone for break so manager came to deal with us  and did not care about what their sales associate explained to us. She was very rude and disrespected us. She didn't even allow us to buy another  new items from the store since I said they were wasting our time which was absolutely right as their associate involved us to find items so she could help to exchange but manager did misbehave . If I were the main manager I could have fired her and gave her relief  because of bad customer service. She should learn how to deal with customers.|1
3 years ago|CHENISE|I had a horrible interaction around the holidays. I'm only writing about it now because I work in retail and can't stop thinking about how bad this store is. I admit I should have tried on this pant before I bought it, but the sales associate was INCREDIBLY MISLEADING. She said I could exchange the item if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't. So I went back the next day. It was a size 12... I'm a small at Roots so I don't know why I'm a 12 at H&M, but size 14 is not sold in the store (only online which is also dumb). I wanted to exchange for another style to see what fit. I talked to a meek young man, who suggested I try stuff on and he called his manager. Well after trying on 8 pairs of size 12 pants the manager tells me over the WALKIE TALKIE that I actually can't exchange my item. SHE DIDN'T EVEN SHOW HER FACE. I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN. Not only was I lied to in the first place, but the manager is obviously setting a horrible example of customer service and now I'm stuck with an OK mug and a cheese board I don't even use. Oh yeah, I went back a few days later and spoke to some slacker associate who let me exchange for a mug and a cheese board (cuz I obviously cannot buy clothes there. And never will). If you need customer service training, take a peek in this store for some examples.... Of what to avoid.|1
3 years ago|Sarah Radford|No privacy in change rooms.  The  staff was pleasant and it was clean and orgnized despite this I will not return.  The curtains in the changerooms are impossible to fully close.  I struggled to not look in on others changing and knew they could also see me changing.   Increadably uncomfortable and exposing.|1
3 years ago|Andressa Paulino|I bought a coat that I paid cash for, I tried to return the coat because it did not fit me but I had lost the receipt. The staff did not give me any options to help me mend this situation. They were rude and disrespectful to me because I have an accent. I have never felt so belittled before in my life, it made me very upset.|1
6 years ago|Vida Antic-Bakovic|"I have been trying to talk to a sales associate for 2 days now, to check in-store availability of an item. These were the least helpful associates I have ever come across, and I've worked in retail for a long time.  Not a single one of them was willing to help, but kept passing me along to another ""department"", which resulted in about 15min-20min of hold time to a destination where associates didn't pick up the call. Then I was bounced back to another phone line - where I started - where the associate put me on hold again to try and patch through the department that didn't pick up in the first place.  They didn't pick up again, so once again I was passed back to the ""main"" line where they put me on hold again and then hung up. This has happened 4 times now.  For a flagship store, this is unacceptable. Ridiculous even. You should not be this disorganized."|1

3 months ago|Michaela Nudo|I frequently order and purchase things from H&M, particularly their home line. Yet, I find this location to be a bit of a mess with abrasive employees. I went in for a return and to pick up a couple things. I initially couldn’t find the item I was looking for with no employees in sight besides on cash. Then when I went to make the return (only had the return label as my package was missing the slip) the cashier was quite rude and rushing me and trying to touch the app on my phone to pull up the order QR code despite me doing so quite quickly. When it came to the purchase I was making the one item was partially missing and damaged, I had found it in the sale section without an adjusted price. When I asked what it could be discounted the cashier didn’t give me enough time to explain that additionally to one parting being missing, there were also damages. The manager didn’t even give it the time of day and offered 15% off something that half of which was missing or damaged.|2

a year ago|Arushi Dawar|"I was there just this weekend and got some stuff. When at the register, the guy charged me full price for an item that was on sale. So I had to go back and get that fixed and the person at the counter did not even apologise. What's worst, I go back home and check the same thing again, they forgot to take the big security tag off the cardigan, so I had to go back again the next day. I am at the counter again with my receipt and expressing my disappointment and the guy replies ""Oh well, that's too bad, isn't it"" with no hint or sign of apology.  One of the worst customer service I have ever expereinced. I am not upset because they made a mistake, what upsets me is the fact how certain retail employees talk to people. If you have work in the service industry, better have the correct manners and the right attitude.  And in saying that, I have worked in retail myself and never treated people like this."|2

10 years ago|Ra Him|I'm a huge fan of Joeys back in Alberta because of their food and service (absolutely outstanding customer service at the NE Calgary location).  The joeys here is TERRIBLE.  The same dish I order in Calgary (lobster ravioli) tasted so poorly made...and the service? ....rude & quite frankly demeaning.  The waitress got my friend's order wrong (gave her a chicken pasta instead of veggie pasta), and instead of apologizing, she made it seem like it was my friend's fault and brought the manager over.  He asked why she couldn't *just* eat the chicken!  Will never go back there again, and making sure to tell everyone about my experience.|2

Prices are fair but quality of clothing is quite poor. Don't expect merchandise to last long. Store is clean but not really laid out that well likely do to expansion of size over years. Staff is not very helpful. They seem much more interested in stocking shelves rather than assisting customers.|3
2 years ago|Gricelda Molina|You are not allow to try clothes which is understandable with the Coronavirus but if clothes don't fit you and they are on sale  you don't get return.  You are forced to buy something else even if you don't need anything else or you don't like anything.  Instead at Joe Fresh you can try clothes on and you can buy them and even if they are on sale you get a return. That's why I say caring about the clients in these difficult times.|3

3 years ago|Jenny Y|This H&M location is huge, spans several floors and has men's, ladies, kids, and home departments. The clothes are trendy but low quality in terms of material and sewing. Music is blasting and sometimes there are screaming kids running around which makes for a stressful shopping experience. That being said, I'm usually able to find something I like here for a good price, I just have to be prepared to search for it.|3
a year ago|C S|I’d never had a bad experience here until recently.  I was in H&M kids and my autistic brother attempted to hug a mannequins  This man suddenly appeared and looked as though if I hadn’t seen him, he would have taken my brother’s arms and physically stopped him.  If he’s a customer then this is a weird security issue.  If he is an employee I would like to give some advice on handling future issues like this.  1. Without attempting to touch the child, speak to the guardian. Alert them of the situation- they probably didn’t notice. If necessary explain the risks and tell the guardian that the child cannot be doing what they’re doing.  2. If that does not work, alert a security guard to explain it to them again and to tell them that if it happens again they need to leave the store.  3.

3 years ago|Jonathan K|Remember being a kid and hiding inside the clothes racks? That was fun. Now you're old and buying your own inexpensive designer clothes that you dont need. Maybe fashion is more important than the world burning. Hmm. Gentlemen, I shop here when i need xs or small. If you are a bigger gent, I'd not spend too much time. Zara wins on quality. Did you know clothing is huge part of the garbage waste problem. Well, we shouldn't live in such a damn cold place.|3

3 months ago|Mr Review|A good H&M location! Great selection, in multiple sizes. The fitting rooms were the downside. I don't know who designed this rounded curtain fitting room but I could see the people outside in the mirror through an unlosable crack in the curtain. The privacy was lacking. Don't sacrifice functionality for appearance, especially for a fitting room.|4
3 years ago|Tung Nguyen|I've been to the H&M store in Seoul, when they reduce the price 50-60% as I have bought many fine clothes. Even here, however, 70% discount but prices are still high compared to prices in Korea. I see there aren't many clients here. Probably also because people in this city prefer other famous brands.|4
3 months ago|Pat Ferret|Nice variety of products. As a graphic designer, I found it a bit hard to navigate the store. Could have better signage.|4
7 months ago|Vo Phuong|I was trying on the items and asked for a different size of a shirt which I picked from the rack. All the sizes were there, but the girl who went for the S.W.A.T literally said it was an online return. I had to go down to pick the size by myself. I didn’t want to ask her to go check again but I work at H&M too, so I know how the price tags from online return look like. That was a dishonest customer service from that staff, and I am disappointed with her working behavior.|4
10 months ago|shahrooz shamsizadeh|H&M The big branch of store on Eaton Center it's located on three levels and there was all kind of clothes foe kids and men and women. The place was clean and the stuff was kind and helpful. There was a little crowded and there was a line to pay. The price is firm and the quality and quantity of goods are acceptable. I recommend it.|4
10 months ago|Roohani Naik|I like the rate of change in the collection at this particular outlet. There is a shuffle of clothes displayed on the rack, almost, every other day. I dig the color palette of their clothes. It's often very preppy and casual. The price is affordable. The staff is sweet and helpful if you are respectful especially the ones in charge of changing rooms. The rooms are kept quite clean and they smell nice. The place itself is accessible. It is right on the side of the mall metro exit and in front of Yonge Dundas square. Can't miss it. There are two eaton mall elevators right beside the store.|4

3 years ago|Elizabeth Friesen|A very busy location, but always slightly messy due to the high volume of customers. The staff are constantly restocking and refolding, so it's not as though the store is being neglected. The cashiers are very friendly and the floor staff are helpful. With 3 floors, I always find many items I want. Everything is always on trend and the sale items are ridiculously inexpensive. The sizing is consistent so, once you know your size, you don't necessarily have to try everything on. The have a generous return/exchange policy, which makes returning items super easy, if you find you've made a mistake. Their jeans, in particular, are extremely well-priced. This is my go-to location. 😊|4

The reason for the star deduction  is because the space is not big enough between customers and also the fact that there was an alarming amount  of people inside|4
2 years ago|Samar Pattanayak|It's good place to buy your daily casual dresses both for men and women. You can buy t-shirt starting with $7 with different varieties. Good collection of jackets, caps trousers are there. You can find few home decor stuffs but it has very limited varieties. I visited during Covid, they have proper sanitization process for visiting customers. Good to visit.|4

Stick to your job and secure the store by stopping shoplifters not children who just want to feel the clothes on the mannequins.  Love this location because it's the first I'VE seen with a housewares section.  Maybe the ladies and children's section should be on the same floor too; seeing that women are the ones doing most of the children shopping. It's a hassle to browse the ladies section then have to run downstairs to the children's... Especially if you have a stroller and cannot use the escalator.|4

9 months ago|Sahar Ullah|I was checked out by Sarushti who was amazing she greeted us so politely acknowledged my 7 year as well and offered us to sign up for H & M rewards and helped us get an additional 10 percents off. The deals were great to begin with and the store it self looked and felt very organized!|5
a year ago|Paco Archi|It’s their flag ship next to Dundas square. The store  just got renovated I believe a couple a years ago . So it looks really good. From The lights and the  design  of the store to the collections  they keep changing on weekly basis. Def best H&M in Toronto hands down|5
a month ago|Farddana Diana Selim|Bought this beautiful long ribbed dress from H&M! I tried it on and it fit me amazingly! I love it so much. I feel like this location H&M has more stuff than the other location I guess because this location is bigger! Still very beautiful and modest dress😍🙌🏼 …|5
2 months ago|Latoyah Victorious|I love that they have clothing attire for almost every occasion and their pricing is not so bad. I love their winter collections and will most certainly be back. I recommend|5
a month ago|Adam Belanger|I love this H&M, the organization of the store is amazing, and seems to be the only H&M where the sizing is accurate. I'm a bit of a bigger guy and usually at other H&M's I need a 4XL which is not accurate, at this store I can always find a L or XL that fits perfectly. If your going to an H&M it's worth it to go to this location.|5

10 months ago|Vijay Gupta|Huge place to shop for really stylish and budget options for mens/women and kids. This place is right above Yonge and Dundas subway. Very reachable and convenient.|5
10 months ago|Karen Ramos|"This store is like a fashion wonderland.  So many choices, all organized and displayed in a clear and uncluttered way.  I went to try something on, and the attendant was so polite.  He thanked me for trying stuff on (this never happens anywhere) and when I told him I was going to take some of the items, he said, ""Oh great!"", like he was happy for me, lol.  The other staff also seemed happy and though they were working, they were laughing together and seemed relaxed.  This was really nice to see. Security is in place but not overbearing or in your way.  I will definitely return for more fashion inspiration at this flagship location."|5

9 months ago|Md. Imtiaz Pathan|It is a very crowded place all the time . So many customers goes here everyday. Very nice decoration inside the showroom. Separate place for men-women- children. And they have separate changing rooms also. This brand shop is very convenient and budget friendly. Canada’s first H&M store opened on March 11th, 2004 at Toronto’s Fairview Mall. The 12,000 square foot store was met with much fanfare and a week later, its second Canadian location opened at The Promenade in Thornhill, just north of Toronto. Canada’s largest H&M location (at 33,000 square feet) opened in the fall of 2004 at the Toronto Eaton Centre.|5
a year ago|Catia Martins|Our go-to for good quality, fashionable clothing at reasonable prices. Kids' clothing, especially, is very high quality and washes well. Women's clothing, as well. Love this blazers and trousers- favourite work pieces. This store is well organized and easy (enough) to navigate, considering it spans multiple levels.|5

3 years ago|Fernando Torres|This is a very good spot. I went here with my daughters and they found a great variety on clothing and accessories. They had fun choosing some of their favorite things and getting they liked the best. Good quality clothing, reasonable cost and trendy stuff. Good combination. The waiting time for the fitting rooms though, was a bit long. Not sure if this is because it was a Friday or this is always like that. Anyway, we'll be coming back. My daughters liked the experience at this place.|5

3 years ago|Surbhi Sareen|I have always loved the type of clothes they offer. The deals are always great. I got my graduation Sandals from there and they are very comfortable. Above that, I got one high waist jean which turned out to be a perfect for me. They provide amazing customer service and it’s reasonable if you follow the offers.|5
2 years ago|Enaiyat Ghani Ovy|This H&M is located in the Eaton center just at the Dundas square. It is a big store with a good collection of clothes and apparels. Their prices are reasonable and competitive. We like this brand because of the quality of the products. So far, we have positive experience at this store. We actually come to this place quite frequently as to get access to the mall. Outside H&M, you will find some gathering and events that make you feel lively. I would definitely recommend this place.|5
a year ago|Robyn Hancock|Super impressed with how this location has handled sanitization re: covid. They stagger changerooms and thoroughly wipe down in between people. This is the most I've seen done at any retail clothing store. The selection here is also great as it's quite large (3 stories).|5
2 years ago|Matkai Burmaster|This H&M location is superb. Recently renovated and expanded, this store is the largest H&M I have ever seen and it includes H&M, H&M Man, H&M Kids, and H&M Home branches all in the same store. There is always a great selection of products at affordable prices. If you are looking for clearance though, you should try another location as this location doesn't typically have much clearance options due to its high-traffic location, dependancy on tourist revenue, and iconic status in the Eaton Centre.  Overall, a fantastic H&M location and a great place to find new clothes, shoes, and home decor.|5

2 years ago|Save Graves|Have been looking forever for white cotton tube top, strapless bra for a certain sundress. Finally found the perfect one at H & M for about $17 CAD. Thrilled. Eyelet cotton is pretty and very comfy. Doesn't fall down becuz has side wire. ❤️|5

4 years ago|Rob Young|First time in H&M to actually shop in years, and i am very impressed with the renovations and how things are now. Ultra crowded though, but there's a HUGE selection of merchandise. I really liked the lighting, the cleanliness of the floor, and the ability to have a conversation with the staff. Change rooms were clean and private with a 7 item limit and the mirror allowed for perfect selfies. Nothing negative to say about it other than it being crowded on weekends, and a bit tough to navigate with so much stuff around, but I suppose that's Marketing 101 anyway.|5

2 years ago|Colin White|If clubs to reopen , this is where I would go to get disposable clothing I'm talking about V neck and crew neck tops for $5 if you really need a cheap pair of jeans for a special occasion that you're probly gonna throw out or spill something on, this is where you would go because it would cost you under $20 for an outfit. Places like this are essential in this economic time period during the pandemic this store was the 1st to open their flagship store and stay open when stores reopen. They all were able to open during the end of phase one|5

As for products they have lots of variety at this location including houseware items, decor, kid's section, women's and men's. Reccomend going to this location as you could probably find almost everything you are looking for fashion wise.|5
3 years ago|P Kaur|My favourite location of H&M. Staff is helpful. I like the layout of all the clothes here. Somehow the other locations don't cut it. And the prices are not too bad either.|5
9 years ago|Bill Bradstreet|I've been going to Joey for over a year now. I go once a week (literally, every week). The food is great. The price is reasonable for what you get. There are plenty of TVs in the bar for watching sports. During the summer, they open the walls up in one section of the dining area so you can almost sit outside.|5
a year ago|Adrien|Great clothing for a reasonable cost! The tops look appealing and bottoms are one of a kind. Every visit to the mall guarantees a visit to H & M.|5
4 years ago|Monteiro Cassia|My Favorite H&M in Toronto, always has sizes . Display is so not crowded. Staff  check up on you which is unheard of for this store. No matter where I am, I'll wait to get back to this location. second floor has great sales|5

My favorite section at H&M Eaton Centre. Housewares.  H&M accepts Cash, Debit, Visa and Master Card. They do not Accept American Express card.|5
