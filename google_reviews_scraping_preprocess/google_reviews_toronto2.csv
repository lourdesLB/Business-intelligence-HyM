7 months ago|Lem H|I purchased a men’s belt on July 3,2022 at this store. When I approached the cash counter no greeting what’s so ever. A tall young black male behind the counter cashed me out. Not a word during the whole time. I told him the belt on sale on H&M website and show him the price. He cashed me out by saying no return on sale item. I asked him if possible to punch more holes on the belt he unwillingly replied “no”. No “hi”, no “thank you” nothing the whole time while I was there. May be I’m an old fashion simple thank you would long way. To me, it appears he doesn’t want to be there serving customers. He need to understand there are many young people loved to have a job like he has.|1

6 months ago|Michelin|The store does not update their inventory ever. Drove 30 minutes just to find out that every size was sold and not a single piece of item was available when it showed online that all sizes were available for that item. Zero care from the workers or management.|1
a year ago|Cristina Manzone|I wish I could rate the customer service a 0! I wanted to exchange an item. I had a gift receipt and the store manager would not offer me an exchange or a  store credit. Item had tags on it, was never worn and was a Christmas gift.  I assured her that I was about to spend alot more and she was very rude and would not help. Be prepared, if you want to return something at this store, they DO NOT honour their store policy and the manager will give you a hard time.  I will never shop at this location again. I will support other locations or buy online. This post is strictly based on my experience with the store manager. I contacted head office and I hope she is spoken to about how she speaks to her customers.|1

9 months ago|marissa theakston|It’s always so nice hearing staff that work at the store talking about how dumb customers are because of simple questions being asked, definitely not okay. It was a woman with blunt black hair that worked may 31st 2022 wearing a green top at 7:16 pm near the front of the store|1
a year ago|Czarina Payopay|Dear H&M even if you dont allow returns for selected items, at least do so if a product is defective. Well what can a large company lose so you wont probably care. Talk about you get what you pay for principle|1
a year ago|Des zamkov|Went to Vaughan Mills last night Waited 25 minutes to get into the mall Picked out what I wanted from  H&M. Product I had to exchange still had tags on them and was told Sorry we can't exchange it. I was baffled as I have no issues anywhere else I was returning the same top just for a smaller size. Really Frustrating  .  Poor quality for customer service as not even the manager would try to come up with a solution.|1
a year ago|Tyrrel Tomlinson|This is the worst H&M in the GTA! Do not shop here. This store is run by some horrible troll Karen who yells at customers when they have issues. I tried to return two spring jackets I bought within the hour. The troll lady denied the refund because they were sale items. I was neither aware nor was I told that sale items were final when I was cashing out. (very dishonest policy but that’s another story)  She  (maybe a he?) then started shouting at me and so rudely stated that I couldn’t read because the return policy is on the receipt.  When I responded she charged at me and then threatened to call security on me (lowkey a racial attack because I’m a black male re: Central Park Karen lady)  I’m so disgusted. I will never shop at H&M again.|1
a year ago|Cindy Mahn|Went into the vaughanmills location on July 28th around 630pm  to shop and was treated with such rude and unapproachable manner by seems to be MOD on duty ..she was petite Asian and when i approached her to ask return policy for sale items and where the cash counter was..she rolled her  eyes and pointed at cash as i was inconveniencing her. Imagine the rest of the team must be treating other customers if the manager on duty was acting in such manner. I will not be returning tp thi location. Totally unprofessional manner. I will go to that location again.|1
3 years ago|SANTINO D|Don't shop at H&M. Tried to exchange an Xmas gift for my child. I had the pants in my hand the return and the exact same pants just 2 sizes larger. They refused to do the exchange. So arrogant and rude. We don't do exchanges without receipts. Same pants just larger and you say no. what is this world coming to. This company will definitely be out of business soon.|1
a year ago|Gabriella Ree|Messy store. Unhelpful workers. Asked one a question he completely ignored me and I asked again and he ignored me for a call on his radio intercom. Ended up not buying anything because 3 different employees walked into me and pushed passed me. Rather then waiting the 5 secs for me to get where I’m going.|1
5 years ago|Amirhossein Nosrati|This H&M is simply terrible in customer service. The employees are unprofessional in past couple of times I visited. Even the managers are rude with lack of knowledge about their own promotions. I visited other H&M and never had any problems but here in Vaughan Mills, every single time they drive me crazy. Could you please teach your employees and manager in this branch how to respect customers and teach them about H&M promotions and policies. I know H&M policies better than the managers that I had to show them the print out even once. So disgusting and disappointing! Never ever gonna shop in this branch.|1
4 years ago|kgolo ndlovu|This is the worst H&M i have been to in my entire life. I have lived in Sweden for many years and know how H&M operates. I go to the one in Eaton centre and Bloor, those are my local ones, the stuff is great and know how to keep their stores clean. But this time, we decided to go there thanks to the Lego Discovery Centre.  I had a terrible accident in there due to their negligence, and still nursing my injury 3 weeks later. They had no 1st aid kit, they were terrible with first aid, as a family we had to DIY the 1st aid. They took our details and said they were gonna check on me that very week. NEVER HAPPENED! I am still waiting, but 3 weeks later, come on.|1
3 years ago|Joseph K|Horrible service. Staff is extremely rude. I just got surgery and ask to have some stuff held at the front so I couldn’t carry is. They lost all the stuff I put in the front within a matter of 5 min. I had to go recollect what I could injured. Then she gave me back over $50 in 10s when there was bigger bills in the till and I asked for them.|1
2 years ago|Isaac N|I attempted to return a single item without a receipt at this store last weekend. They gave me a number to call customer service and C. service didn't do anything for me; useless. The manager at this store came off as EXTREMELY ARROGANT and rude. I'm not coming back here.|1
5 years ago|Yana Ab|This H&M provides unbelievably disgusting customer service. H&M itself is one of the best fashion retails and always has the best prices and qualities but staff here are extremely rude! If you think you call a manager and attitudes are going to change?! WRONG! Managers are the same...they are working there to ruin your shopping experience. If you call for help, they gonna ignore you...if you complain about that, they gonna blame you!!!!!! If you call this store for a check, no answer! If you want to pay for ur items, don't expect any kind of greeting at cash. Try to go to yorkdale or hillcrest mall! They provide good service|1
5 years ago|Natasha Bouyard|For the life of me I can't stand ANY of the employees at this location they are so rude, unhelpful, disrespectful and FULL OF ATTITUDE.

7 months ago|Marie C|Browsed around the store last Thursday morning. It seemed like everyone was working at a snails pace except for two staff members (the girl in the fitting room + a young man at the men’s pay/checkout area). Everyone else clearly needed some coffee. Store seemed tidy, wide selection of items to choose from but not the best customer service. I suggest shopping at another H&M location, or online|2
3 months ago|Asma Sajid Ali|No mirrors placed anywhere in the store. - a very elaborate strategy by management to make people go to the fitting rooms if they need a mirror.|2
a year ago|Patrick smith|I bought a scarf set with glove and tam I didn't notice one of the gloves was missing until I got home. I live way to far to go back for it so it's just a lost for me I mean I can still rock the scarf and tam but I had to use an old black glove I had to wear with my new one glove problem solved I guess but h&m needs to make sure their items are fully stock with all that comes with it. Other than that nice clothes.|2
4 years ago|anpanman|I loved the place a couple years ago but something changed, no it wasn’t the prices or the service. Something just felt off as if something or someone was missing, i can’t very well put my finger on it.. But i definitely miss whatever it was. I will admit some of the sales associates are amazing and they provide great service! Even when it gets busy the employees definitely know how to work under pressure delivering great customer service, at a very efficient rate! & they got rid of divided grey for men..|2

3 years ago|ARUN CAN|Not really the tidiest of H&M you might find around. The cloths are all mixed up and is really difficult to find a particular type. Being in Vaughan Mills makes it more crowded. Visit an H&M at a nearby mall near you and you can find what you are looking for much easily.|2
3 years ago|sanjay p|Stood at cashier while two employees walked right past me. A third employee came and said cash was closed. How about a sign? How about acknowledging a customer and saying this cash is closed but someone can help you at another cash. I left without  buying..|2

a year ago|Josh Castillo|H&M at Vaughan Mills is a decent store to visit when looking for mens or womens apparel. The quality of clothing is not the best but fair for the price points. The store follows Covid-19 protocols and ensures everyone has a mask. The store is somewhat clean and organized. I'd recommend visiting other apparel stores but H&M is good enough as well.|3

They are losing ground to their main competition ZARA. The staff are non exists except for a cashier and a couple folding clothes.

The cashier even helped us save a bit more by using the H&M app because “diapers are expensive”...I agree haha. Anyways my only problem was that a lot of the sizing wasn’t available and it was very disorganized (can forgive for a late Saturday afternoon visit). Staff were busy folding and putting clothes away, it’s just a shame customers can be so shameless and messy lol.|4

Even asked if he could put it on for her, she loved it!!!|4

Due to covid their policy allows 30 days exchange as you cannot try on clothes at the store or you choose not too. Try another location im sure you will succeed. I did exact same thing with no issues..Heartland location.|5

I was given a task to pick up clothes for my uncle who is getting married. I picked up a women's blouse and kids pants for my uncle. LOL! Michelle was my saviour who didn't make assumptions and constantly communicated everything over the app. She asked all the right questions and quickly figured out my mistake. She helped me pick the right clothes and guided me every step of the way! Thank you very much, Michelle, for going above and beyond the call of duty! It was already a very stressful day for me, and your presence of mind saved me! I wish you all the success in the world.|5

There is an entrance from outside the mall as well as access to the store through the mall. This H&M location keeps mall hours and opens and closes at the same time as mall hours are stated. Although Vaughan Mills does have some outlet stores, this H&M is NOT an outlet, it is a regular clothing store with the same in season clothing items available at other locations and online.|5

10 years ago|Joy Hawkins|I love the stores in this mall.  To highlight a few, they have an UGG store, which is awesome.  They are also getting a Legoland in March which basically will make every child want to go shopping with their mother.  The Bass Pro makes my husband actually okay with going shopping with me and they have a Safari store that is like a huge pet store which is very fun for kids.  The layout of the mall is great and it's really easy to get around for people who are disabled.  My husband pulled a tendon in his leg and can't walk at the moment and they had motorized scooter so he was able to get around easily.|5
