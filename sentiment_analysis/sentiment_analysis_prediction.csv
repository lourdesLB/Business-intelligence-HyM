quora|The quality of H&M's clothes is really poor. Some clothes are very thin. After buying them and washing them several times, they not only wrinkled like a rag but also pilled! Upper class design + upper class tailoring, used on fabrics that are not upper class. So, don't expect to wear these clothes for a season, it only takes 15 days from new arrival to delivery, we are not so fast for professional fabrics. Therefore, it takes about 15 days for the brand's utilization rate of a piece of clothing and its time to market. So, if you are looking for value for money, don't choose such a brand. Although the single purchase amount is not high, continuous purchases can drive you crazy.|LABEL_0|0.9798794388771057
quora|H&M is one of the fast fashion brands, and my friends around me have a bad evaluation of its clothing. Although the price is cheap, the quality of the clothing is greatly reduced. The people who choose to purchase are also price-driven. Therefore, considering the sustainable development of the clothing industry, competitive prices and high-quality product supply are more popular and develop longer. FashionTIY online clothing wholesale platform is also one of the fashion brands. Its differences are: 1.Competitive 70%+ cheap wholesale price 2. Strict quality control and packaging 3.100K+ fashionable clothing styles 4. Up to 30 days of after-sales service The pictures and price display of some clothing (knitted tops and jackets and fashionable bottoms) from this platform, hope to help you!|LABEL_0|0.7076248526573181
quora|As we all know, H&M is known for making cheap fashion and the quality will not be the best compared to high end brands. But because of its affordable price, the quality of H&M is worth it. If you're after quality apparel at low prices, consider FashionTIY! A staple in the fashion industry, the site offers a huge assortment of clothing and styles for both men and women at prices at least 70% cheaper. Their garments are extremely durable and the fabrics are super comfortable and hold their shape even after multiple washes.|LABEL_1|0.9613500833511353
quora|I can’t say what would you prefer as good quality but, If you are asking about H&M brand clothes I would suggest that all thing is to depend upon the price of it if you would take a higher price shirt you will get more fabric on it instead if you go through with low price material you will get a low amount of fabric that has used in that clothes. More videos are available on Youtube that helps you how to check the quality of the clothes go through them and check them out. Hope so you would be satisfied with my answer.|LABEL_1|0.8795090913772583

The quality from H&M products is awful - they aren’t meant to be worn for more than one season unless they’re basics like shirts. Certain pieces, particularly footwear, fall apart super easily and destroy your feet. The culture of throwing out so much clothing is environmentally destructive. Fast fashion (although Zara is much more guilty of this) is also pretty much just about copying directly from designers as closely as legally possible, although you can argue that this is how all fashion works anyway. Finally, fast fashion does not create a culture where people actually place value in their clothing. I find it much better to have good quality, upper-middle fashion (if not full-on high fashion pieces) that look great, feel great and last forever. They stay with you and you become more particular about picking out clothes - you’ll avoid impulse buying things just because and you’ll learn to only get clothes that are worth it on you. It’s far better for crafting your own individual style when you have that kind of mindset. When it’s for simple basics then go ahead, do it. I buy plenty of H&M and Zara myself because I’m a poor fuck. However, when it comes to the statement pieces, clothes that actually need to last and things that generally matter to my look more (outerwear, jackets, footwear), I stay the fuck away. I mean, people always seem to forget that there are many, many places where you can buy second-hand clothes for cheap. If money is the problem I say that’s what you should do instead.|LABEL_0|0.9738844037055969
quora|I love the brand. It’s one of the places I have been shopping for most of my wardrobe. I make minimum wage and go to college so I don’t have much to spend. I have tried thrifting, but since I’m an XS/0 it’s hard to find clothes that are in my size while I’m there. As long as I wash my H&M clothes on cold and low dry them, they have lasted for many years. I usually buy minimalist pieces rather than the flashy/trendy statement shirts unless they collaborated with an artist/show I like. Even then, my pieces from 2 years ago are still relevant in style today|LABEL_1|0.815133810043335
quora|So today, my dad decided to take me for shopping as my birthday's almost knocking on my door! As we were window shopping in Westend Mall, I decided to check out the H&M store for the first time. I've never really been fond of fancy clothes and always end up buying boy's t shirts wherever I go and then when I've to go to a function, I cannot just find a suitable outfit to wear. Yeah, that's me! :P H&M as I checked the women's section stores more formal clothes than casual ones (I'm talking about the Westend Mall outlet). There were full sleeved shirts and blazers of numerous designs. I wanted something casual, to wear on my birthday and hence, finally ended up scanning the casual section of the store. Let me tell you, I'm not lean and lanky. When you're a foodie, you cannot help it though. Half the clothings in the casual & trendy section were either crop tops or so short that it would just hang till the edge of my hip. I raise one hand, and my bare stomach would be visible. Finally, after a thorough search, found 2 very decent looking tops which fortunately, fit me perfectly. Checked the price tags and found it to be extremely cheap as there's this 70% discount going on currently which didn't make me think twice and buy both of them. I got two 2299/— tops for only 450/— each. So yes, if you're looking for pocket friendly clothes to wear, then the store is for you. I didn't find anything odd with the clothing quality unlike the writers who've posted their views here. The quality is really good and I never wear anything that's not comfy. But here, I found the material to be really soothing and very comfy.|LABEL_1|0.7217081189155579
