Upper class design + upper class tailoring, used on fabrics that are not upper class. So, don't expect to wear these clothes for a season, it only takes 15 days from new arrival to delivery, we are not so fast for professional fabrics. Therefore, it takes about 15 days for the brand's utilization rate of a piece of clothing and its time to market. So, if you are looking for value for money, don't choose such a brand.

The quality from H&M products is awful - they aren’t meant to be worn for more than one season unless they’re basics like shirts.

Fast fashion (although Zara is much more guilty of this) is also pretty much just about copying directly from designers as closely as legally possible, although you can argue that this is how all fashion works anyway. Finally, fast fashion does not create a culture where people actually place value in their clothing. I find it much better to have good quality, upper-middle fashion (if not full-on high fashion pieces) that look great, feel great and last forever. They stay with you and you become more particular about picking out clothes - you’ll avoid impulse buying things just because and you’ll learn to only get clothes that are worth it on you. It’s far better for crafting your own individual style when you have that kind of mindset. When it’s for simple basics then go ahead, do it. I buy plenty of H&M and Zara myself because I’m a poor fuck. However, when it comes to the statement pieces, clothes that actually need to last and things that generally matter to my look more (outerwear, jackets, footwear), I stay the fuck away.

As we were window shopping in Westend Mall, I decided to check out the H&M store for the first time. I've never really been fond of fancy clothes and always end up buying boy's t shirts wherever I go and then when I've to go to a function, I cannot just find a suitable outfit to wear. Yeah, that's me! :P H&M as I checked the women's section stores more formal clothes than casual ones (I'm talking about the Westend Mall outlet). There were full sleeved shirts and blazers of numerous designs. I wanted something casual, to wear on my birthday and hence, finally ended up scanning the casual section of the store. Let me tell you, I'm not lean and lanky. When you're a foodie, you cannot help it though. Half the clothings in the casual & trendy section were either crop tops or so short that it would just hang till the edge of my hip. I raise one hand, and my bare stomach would be visible. Finally, after a thorough search, found 2 very decent looking tops which fortunately, fit me perfectly. Checked the price tags and found it to be extremely cheap as there's this 70% discount going on currently which didn't make me think twice and buy both of them. I got two 2299/— tops for only 450/— each. So yes, if you're looking for pocket friendly clothes to wear, then the store is for you. I didn't find anything odd with the clothing quality unlike the writers who've posted their views here. The quality is really good and I never wear anything that's not comfy.
