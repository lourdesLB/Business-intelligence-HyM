review|class
Lifts poorly located in the far corner. Kids dept was far at the top level which should be located more conveniently. Staff at the till in ladieswear were unfriendly and unhelpful. The 'SYSTEM' was giving a higher price than the label and the assistant said the label was wrong - well you were wrong as The Manager came to resolve! Basic Customer Service training needed. I didn't feel I was a valued customer. Then the Assistant couldn't help to get another item from the upper level, 'I can't leave the till blah blah blah' - think outside of the box! I had 3 children and your store layout is ridiculous. Your prices were not correct and items for the 3 for 2 promotion were wrongly placed which inconvenienced me and so I left them. 3 white tshirts for PE £2.99 and the next size up £9.99 which didnt make sense. Very very dissapointed as all sizes upto 14+ are £2.99 online but the 3 for 2 and promo is not online! Waste of time! Staff should handle the situation better! I just want good service!|0
I experienced racism! It's so bad.. The cashier asked to use self check service but didn't help me remove the security tag! When I came back home I found it still locked on my clothes.|0
Very Unprofessional staff.  Manager kitty was such a rude person. Her behaviour was very unprofessional. We brought something from the shop but forgot to take the tags off. Apparently had to come back for this. Member of staff checked everything and took it off. All of sudden another member of staff stopped us by the door and took the shopping away. Asked to go to till in a very rude way regardless listening to our statement. Even when we went to till she wasn’t interested to listen straight way called manager (kitty) and there started interesting part. She came up to us with very loud voice like we stole million pound. We been requesting again and again to go and talk to her staff who sorted things for us. She was almost screaming with us front of all other customers and everyone was looking at us. Tbh I felt so down. Anyway at the end she apologised to us and admitted her mistake. If management watching this review then,All I want from H&M is to train those unprofessional, overexcited and uncivilised staff like KITTY.|0
Unprofessional staff, not all of them but the guy at ladies fitting room is very arrogant and he thinks the customers are his workers. Very disrespectful. This happened on 5th nov at 18:30.|0
I bought 3 items at this store at around 8:30pm on 15 Aug but the staff just packed 2 items into the bag. I came back to ask for camera check but they promised to check in the next day then contact me via my phone number even it was the last day I stayed there. There's no response until now, I cannot come back there to check. Customer service here is poor.|0
Nice place to visit but very poor children formal clothes quality and no options.|0
They seem to have sacked 80% of their checkout staff and replaced them with ineffective self checkout terminals that most people seemingly can't operate.  I was queuing for about 20 minutes today with no movement before giving up and walking out.  It's as if they are trying to make the retail experience so unpleasant that we'd rather shop online to save ourselves the frustration 🤔|0
Terrible customer service.  We struggled to self check and there was no one to assist us. After waiting over 5 minutes for assistance we had to go to try and find someone for help.  We couldn't find anyone on the floor.  Eventually a very rude person came to the till to take our money, no hello, no apology, nothing! Worst shopping experience ever.  I would not recommend this store and I will never use the company again. Appalling service and treatment!|0
Customer service is appalling. I had questions about where the shoes were so I went up to a lady who I’m assuming was the manager (brunette, white) and she wagged her finger no at me and walked straight past me and I went up to another retail worker and she had a lot of attitude when I asked her. Disgusting|0
One of their employees literally shoved me out of the way when I was looking for something and was very rude, you guys really need to sort your staff out|0
Awful customers service. I was so chocked because the online customer service is really good. Team member at the cash desk were having personal conversation and laughing out loud between them while serving customers . A manager with long brown hair came to authorised a refund and gave attitude to the customer without even talking the her. What an awful experience to be given attitude by someone in charge in the store .Never ever again . I’ll just keep buying on line. The perfect exemple showing why online business is taking over store’s business.|0
COMPLAINT:  About the staff members in H&M Westfield Stratford (). I asked the cashier () specifically to exchange an online item with an item in store, I left both items on the desk (making it even more obvious that I wanted an exchange) However she automatically returned it, and did nothing about it. I asked the manager, she was abrupt and did not resolve the issue instead was very blunt, that they can't do anything about it. They did  not listen, instead they were very rude. I went earlier that day, and asked the manager and he said it was perfectly fine as long as the items matched the same price It was really sad, the other manager was not sympathetic at all, when I kept telling her my situation about my family relative, she abruptly repeated 'we can't do anything about it'.|0
Very rude staff! I had a very bad experience in this shop. I love H&M and I am a loyal customer but when the people who work treat you disrespectfully you are very sad after! I have never seen a shop with more ugly staff than this!|0
I was at the Stratford, Westfield branch of H&M and a few young staff members decided to follow me around the shop, they never asked if I needed help, but they were always behind me as if I was going to steal something. I would like this matter to be taken seriously, as this is very racist and prejudice. If this happens again I will take serious legal action and will raise awareness that H&M has staff members who have unconscious bias towards a specific demographic. If come back again and treated the same way I will report you to the Local Government Authority which owns the property. Please train your staff to avoid childishly following Black people, if they felt something was going to be stolen, they should have followed at a great distance so it won't ruin customer experience. I did not confront them about it as I did not want a commotion, but if I experience that treatment again I will make serious vocal complaint to media publications raising aware of the racism in H&M.|0
My mum was robbed at exactly 17:30 on the 4th of September in the Stratford branch, and the staff showed no compassion. They've done nothing to help. This store clearly isn't the safest place to be in.  Pickpocketing is one thing but robbery is another. Obviously the security aren't very useless. When my mum came home she was shivering; she had to walk because they took her phone and all her cards. She is diabetic and now she is scared to go out by herself. This is how HM treats their customers so poorly. My mum gave the full description of the culprit; it was a lady wearing the hijab but nothing has been done; instead the staff were showing attitude as if it was her fault she was robbed.|0
Great products. Second h&m in one day with rude staff on the entrance. We are all under the pressure but there 8s no need to be rude. Just before that visited other shop from different brand with very nice and friendly people around. Please work with your staff.|0
Terrible customer service today. Staff leaving till seven when massive queue. Rude staff at till whispering behind customer back. Ignored by staff member who was in front of me in downstairs till. 13:33 store GB0911 sa 132231 no 9259|0
Terrible experience. Not only H&M has terrible return policy where you can’t do straight forward  exchanges. I bought something online on Black Friday sale, size was too big so wanted to go for smaller size. Couldn’t get it for the same price as originally as you can’t exchange items. You need to return it and buy it again and of course price went back it original one. Then you go to store to return item and code that is on my label didn't work. Haven’t been offered any alternative solution or apology. I was just left with: “oh, the code doesn’t work and you need to return it online” send off. Won’t be shopping at H&M again.  Fix your return policy and poor customer service!|0
The worse H&M I have ever visited, rude staff and that is the only way that they excelled|0
"Horrible and unhelpful staff in the fitting room area ar H&M Westfield Stratford. Two memvers of the staff today at 8.42pm, talking loudly about random conversations in front of me when I came to try some trousers. Then I noticed that I needed a size more and they said they are closing and I cannot come back with the other said, it wasn't even 8.45pm yet! The only thing they said when I mention that I only needed a size more was ""sorry about that.."". It was definitely the most unprofessional service I've seen in retail and will not come back to this shop at all. There are plenty of retailers and definitely providing a better customer service!"|0
New store looks great. Staff are useless. After waiting 30 minutes in a queue, I tried to use my Westfield discount card. He denied it, called for a manager and waited 10 minutes and they didn't come. Paid full price and a young boy left the security tags on the clothes! (Kids wear department) need to make a trip back there tommorow now. Salesman is 138933. Ridiculous|0
Got forced to open a membership account even though I refused and said I didn't need it. Felt very pressured to have to waste ten minutes to open an account just so I could pay for my good.|0
This H&M hassomany choices and varietiesjuat that the guy who was handling the trial room was very impolite and rude. As me and my sister were planning to enter the trial room to try the dresses he stopped us saying we can’t go together which my sister did not understand what he was saying as other H&M stores always allows plus we had a baby. As she moved ahead he said “ do you understand what I am saying. Sorry what is this way of speaking with client asking do you understand.?  At this I was very surprised to his way of talking with the clients. Sorry to say but please train that guy how to speak with clients and to use polite terms and gentleness in speach than  trying to flaunt his style and rudeness. I lost the mood to even buy the clothes and I just tried them and hand it over to him. He needs to tone down his way of speaking. I don’t know his name but he was speaking Italian and had dreads Hair. I wanted to complain right away but was so annoyed and upset that I just walked out of the store.|0
Hello, Yesterday at 4.15pm while I was looking at selling clothes, someone stole my wallet from my bag. I immediately noticed your security guard that were near the exit . He wasn’t helpful at all, just said”  What can I do?”. You should have cameras and view the recorded immediately because the thief was still in the shopping centre and even in your store to rob some of your other costumers.|0
Absolutely APPALLING customer service!!! Would never shop here again. This is the flagstore in London and was shocked to recieve such poor customer service by its sales assistant.  Waited in the queue for more than 20 minutes on the main floor with only 3 Sales Assistants on the till with over 20 customers waiting to be served.  When I eventually reached the top of the queue one the SA’s signed out leaving only 2 members of staff on the tills. What appealed to be a manager, mumbled over tanoy for other SA’s to come onto the tills, no one arrived, the music was also too loud. Waited a further 10 minutes to FINALLY be served with what was an insensitive and crass SA. When I complained to her she was unapologetic, inconsiderate and unconcerned with the fact that loyal customers had been waiting for more than 20/30mins.  Wouldn’t recommend this store in a million years. Its a shame as H&M clothes are lovely and as the flagship store that represents London/England it has been thoroughly let down by its lack of well trained curteous staff. P|0
The staff has forgotten the tag on the clothes,didn't realised until I got home. So I had to returned and waisted 2H traveling because of staff mistake. The manger has just appologies,belived it should have been fair to pay for my time|0
Rubbish customer service who laugh in your face for mistakes they make very unprofessional staff need training on communication and manners|0
I went to Westfield Stratford I  always enjoy shopping at H&M  today I  went to the store I been served by lady called Diena I bought two item to exchange one item was over 27 days I am only allowed to exchange I said that’s fine when I bought new clothes she lift it on the and asked me to pay the deference then I said why did you not exchange she said in a rude way I already made the transaction I said then you have to refund this trouser and then  I can exchange the item she gave me a dirty look I said you waste my time  and yours time she rippled back in a rude way if you are not happy leave your feedback on the website and then I said you are rude can I see your manager she called the manager I said she is rude to me guy working next tell his name was T.J response was to me you are rude I saw you manger standing out there and doing nothing and everyone in the shop are watching us I said this is very unprofessional manger didn’t say nothing apart for that what need to do I said leave it and he said its fine you can go lady I said I think your staff need costumer service training while I am leaving Dienien gave me a  dirty smirk  and no  apologise.|0
Very very slow on the tills. Lack of staff. If paying in cash is a nightmare waiting ages just to pay for 2 things|0
I happened to venture into there new store in Stratford,. Why do they put woman's clothing next to the mens ? I found the men's section  cluttered and disorganised with a boring selection. I was informed by the staff when I managed to find one, to look online. What!!!        Poor customer service|0
Whenever im buying anything from H&M the clothes after 3-4 weeks are not suitable to use anymore. Plenty of holes everywhere etc. Can't believe that primark is way better in terms of quality...|0
Nice style poor poor quality for the prices they have!|0
HATE THIS STORE.THE SECURITY GUARD IS USELESS AND THE STORE MANAGER ON THE BOTTOM FLOOR IS SO RUDE AND RACIST!! MY PHONE GOT STOLEN AND STORE MANAGER DIDNT CARE MADE ME GO THROUGH MORE STRESS. NEVER HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH THAT MUCH DISRESPECT I USE TO LOVE GOING TO THIS STORE BEFORE. NEVER AGAIN!!! MADE A COMPLAINT TO HEAD OFFICE!!|0
Staff can't calculate, I bye 3 for to, 2 of them £6 one £8, and I returned that from £8 for oder from £6, and payed them more re money how is possible I will never shop for h&m on Stratford|0
Poor shopping experience as the staff were non existent and disengaged.|0
Ordered something on-line. Wanted to return at the store as item not as expected. Was advised I need to contact with the customer service after paying for the parking and spending time in a long queue. Very disappointed.|0
Very poor customer service , was there on Friday 2 November 2018 between ( 6/7pm) , they had no bags in store . Manager just keep saying sorry, No action , top of that they charged me 5p for a small paper bag ???? I thought we get charged just for plastic ?? Felt so horrible , I had lot of stuff couldn’t fit everything ( jackets / jeans / jumpers ) in small 5p bags . End up carrying everything in my hand ... so discussed|0
Clothes are nice but music is far too loud. I see people leaving after having their eardrums burst just by walking into the store.|0
Closing the fitting rooms att 45? Make me sad that costumer service is this bad. Not that sad about the fact that I'm not coming back tho.|0
Came in for click and collect. After waiting for 10 minutes at the pick up point I had to queue up in order to speak to a member of staff. Who then sent me back to the collection point and after a few minutes a very rude girl name Adina came and made the experience even worse. I am extremely disappointed with the level of service provided.|0
Rudest workers I’ve ever had to interact with.|0
Everything in there is designed to make you feel ugly.  It is terrible. Do not enter.|0
Shelves look like a jumble sale. Staff rude, pushing past customers and grumpy at checkouts|0
Google map pin is in the wrong location. This store is in Westfield Stratford. Not near Liverpool Street station|0
Plenty of metallica t-shirts but no metallica hoodie. Disappointed|0
Not great|0
Worst hm in the world, staff is rude, the place is a mess, don't go there for the love of god|0
It was awful experience during covid. Especially,  manager Erica!|0
Every time I've popped into H&M, I've come across a store with no sales assistants.|0
Very busy, nothing special, lots of sales but nothing that jumps out at you|0
Not a great selection of man's clothing while female have two three floors..|0
Never there!|0
Very Bad customer service, staff not professional, no manners|0
Is there any staff who actually work here|0
Rude staff in fitting rooms.|0
Poor service|0
Didn't go there|0
Loud music makes it difficult to hear and be heard.|0
Worst company|0
Not there|0
Too crowded|0
Small size|0
Rubbish|0
This is the wrong location!|0
Absolute chaos|0
Staff were so incredibly rude as if the atmosphere in and H&M isn’t already awful enough. The new self check out is ridiculous and I felt judged by staff for not being able to use it properly like I’m supposed to know the procedures.|0
(Translated by Google) Very little choice, no helpful staff in sight  (Original) Bardzo mały wybór ,nie widać personelu pomocnego|0

"I visited on the 24th and bought a few items. The store itself was clean and everything was easy to find. I went to pay in the men's section. I was third in line. A member of staff highly encouraged us to use the self-service rather than speak to a person, quickly explained the process, and said she'd get me a bag.  I scanned the first item, no luck, had to wait for the staff member. She's next to me, explaining to a man and woman how they're not using it right. It's at this point the staff member says, ""Let him do it. Men are better at it."" I was mortified. The staff member then has to stand and scan all my items for me as none of the barcodes work. She walks off as I pay and I am left waiting for a bag. I have to alert the cashier I originally wanted to buy from and they get me a bag instead. All three people could have been served by the cashier in half the time if this staff member had just left us alone.  Upon arriving home, I realize they haven't removed the security tags from two of my items. I now have to go back out (I'll be going to my local one in Norwich, not this one!!) and get the tags taken off before I can wear my purchase.  Awful service and I can't believe what was said by your staff."|0
The cashier and some of the staff were racially profiling customers (black and brown mostly) and treated them differently  had a very bad experience|0
Very disappointed with 16th century fashion that has arrived at H&M. Quality of clothes is a lot of the time questionable. However the shop is tidy and staff is nice|0
I wanted school uniform and they had nothing. Thought they should of had a range at least. Its a really big store.|0
"Beautiful range of clothing and sizes the only problem was the staff at the tills. Approached the tills with my items and two young girls were completely ignoring my presence while serving me talking about Harry Potter and what houses they were in 😂 the only thing I got from the girls were ""thats £15"" and a ""bye"" after i paid. Either the manager didn't care for how they treat customers or they just have the poorest customer service skills ever and should the company should reconsider their staff or get them retrained 😂😂"|0
Store layout makes no sense, it is hard to find items and the never seems to be any staff on the shop floor to ask for help.|0
Hardly any staff and only has plus sizes online and not instore which is quite discriminatory for modern day.|0
Am starting to not like shopping here.. They seem to cater to people that only wear slim fit jeans pants.. I can't find a boot cut or straight fit Jean's pants to safe my life.. and they only had one Jacket line like really summer is over where are the winter collections?|0
"You'd think with this new much bigger store they'd have more staff but they don't. There's always a queue on every floorostly because these rarely more than 3 people on the check out. Because it's a new store staff don't know where anything is and seem unwilling to show you. I was simply directed to ""upstairs"" when I asked for something. Went check out and even tho the queue was more than 20 people deep, someone actually jumped off the cashier to hang clothes up. Very annoyed!"|0
Untidy shop with no customer service|0
Don’t like self check out. I’d rather be served by a human.|0
Disgustingly busy, but it's the weekend. Good range of clothes, even if not my style. The service was slow, even for a weekend. I'd avoid this place at all costs.|0
The H&M home section in the Stratford branch is beautiful, but the staff in the Home section are so unwelcoming. No smile and they make you feel awkward. Really puts me off going there.|0
it so so there is  not much things in a.y stores|0
Although this branch has homeware, nightware, lingerie, sports and the usual Men, Women and Children's, I was not impressed. Been to better laid out and stocked branches.|0
The quality of clothes has gone down drastically since the pandemic, what a shame, it used to be my favourite store|0
Never staff to help you. It's almost like they are shortly staffed|0
Not much for grown ups here.|0
Would give a 4 if they didn't leave security tags on items second time a row!|0
Customer service is terrible!|0
good collection but bad customer service during the Christmas, she didn't even look at me, and it wasn't busy.|0
It's good|0
Nothing available over a 12. Staff difficult to find and disinterested.|0
No options for petite taille|0
Poor customers service|0
Goood|0
Always busy|0
(Translated by Google) The store is large and has a variety of goods, but the prices are very high  (Original) المتجر كبير و فيه تعدد للسلع لكن الاسعار جدا مرتفعة|0
(Translated by Google) Good prices but looking for clothes by size on the label is a struggle  (Original) Preços bom mais procurar roupa por tamanho na etiqueta é uma luta|0
I find that this H&M is not layed out very well. They hardly have any clothing to choose from for boys over 8 years old. The options were very poor and same for ladies clothing. Styles are very boring and I have not been able to find anything I like in this place. H&M used to be my favourite store but I haven't been able to find anything I like for months! There weren't many to choose from.|1
This is a big store and they usually have a huge collection of clothes. The prices are usually affordable. The staff are helpful and try to find the clothes for you if you have any difficulty.|1
Nice big store, missus couldnt find anything she liked bar the home section. Mens section was pretty poor tbh from style to quality and 60quid for cargo bottoms.... have a laugh|1
It was massive as they have 1 on each level. I got there around 5:30pm and they close at 6pm so I did my shopping then it was 5:58 that's when the security came to me pushing  me to get out like he would literally intimidate you to get out even when I had something to pay for.  They clothes are okay  but the nice ones are hidden so you have to spend a lot of time looking.|1
Store it is impecable, although i wont give full stars as i think full experience isnt just about presentation of the store which was great, although girls at the cashier were chatting in between then and not paying attention to the customers, lady no did eye contact,, did not asked me for my customer account for point collection, i was basically doing the job for her. Not really nice, i believe this needa to be managed|1
Brightly lit store with a great layout but their range is simply too 'highstreet' for me. However, you do get what you pay for, is always well stocked and great customer service.|1
I visited to see the items which I saw online but had a hard time locating. I will most likely continue shopping online instead. There was a different layout but I haven't been to this branch in months.|1
I love H&M but need who staff work more customer, I saw some them didn't know self check, staff rude show scan them then they left item lol.|1
Tis was a good experience. They have social distancing in place also the staff are nice. I was waiting in the queue and the young lady at the till was taking forever like super forever. Then another young lady came over and opened up another till, she served me and the original till lady was still serving that same customer. So a nice touch there of customer service.|1
I shop here often, quality is great and so is customer service except one aspect. Usually when I drop clothes off for a voucher I quickly get served and all is good. Today, during busy hours, when I went to drop clothes off for a voucher the staff were awkwardly aware of my presence. After waiting for 10mins I got someones attention and I was told I was supposed to get in the queue. Luckily I was given a voucher immediately due to the inconvenience which I appreciate. But next time staff should be more aware.|1
Came here a few days ago and was bringing some clothes for my friend into her changing room. The lady behind the desk at the changing rooms had a bad attitude towards customers and wouldn’t let me go towards the changing room my friend was in and had a go at me for trying. I didn’t get her name but she has a strong foreign accent.  Other staff members were lovely but this one...  not so much.|1
It was nice and clean. Fitting room staff in the top floor, children section were not enough helpful as they supposed to be. I couldn't buy the clothes which I was interested.|1
Nice shop.... got some pretty stuffs|1
I love this store,it's clean and tidy things are easy to find which is just as well as when I was there the staff were very busy chatting to each other and didn't seen to want to help the shoppers! The security guard on the other hand was very helpful. There wasn't any staff in the changing rooms,it was like a jumble sale in there, very disappointed.. More staff training needed maybe!!|1
The shop is nice having vast variety of cloths. You can get clothes of your choice here at reasonable prices.|1
Good size store, I assumed it would stock a bigger range due to the size of the store. The children department is disappointing as it seems very small. The store is always neat and tidy when I visit. Would be good to have more people serving when busy.|1
New store is a lot better, but the person who came up with the idea of those annoying curtains in the changing rooms is quite silly. 1) they don't fully close 2) the curtains are closed at times even if no ones inside 3) mirrors everywhere so a small gap is very exposing 4) the shop floor assistant opened the curtains on me while I was changing even though the curtains were fully shut. Just save customers the hassle and build standard lockable cubicles.|1
Trailing round after my wife who actually bought something 😳 …|1
Affordable fashion in general, didn't like how unstructured the jackets were...tried a few, didn't buy any...disappointed as I liked the fabrics/ patterns.|1
It's ok , could do with a bit more variety as the stock  looks the same every time you visit 😂 …|1
Did a lot of walking around trying to find things, didn't  appear  to have specific areas , to me it was a muddle.|1
Big store but quene up for fitting room for long time, don't know why they don't open other floor of fitting room as such a large amount of customers waiting|1
Nice store. Very big. Clothes could be organised better.|1
The Stratford Westfield H&M is huge, has lots of variety of things, but there is always a huge queue for the checkouts whenever I've been. Not great when you were hoping to grab something quickly in your lunch break or before heading home from work.|1
Was good, got what I needed on a blazing hot day! Escaped the masses because luckily this shop is at the front. 2021 beh beh.|1
Visited to get a gift card.|1
It’s a lovely place|1
Music is always too loud|1
Wasn't really too happy they didn't have many men's where's especially when it comes to the jeans|1
Good staff not my sort of clothes.|1
Okayish range of clothing however zero. Staff presence of floors, one has to literally scour the floors to find some help.|1
Clothes shop... took mum to return some stuff she bought for my nephew. Clothes were too small ... growing baby|1
Nice stuff but too much busy when I visited.|1
Not a good collection|1
Very busy and the best lines often sell out quickly.|1
Needs a new designer. The clothes are a bit boring nothing I'd really want to buy|1
Not bad but can be better quality and style|1
Was always a good place to shop. Something has changed though... Probably the economy has affected the life of these places|1
No one to ask for help.|1
I like this shop. But why does the candles have no smell when burning|1
Like their ranges. My favourite cargo trousers. Great comfy casual gear|1
Ridiculously long queues, worse than store before. Would be nice to see actual takes not crop tops so much.|1
Nice shop but size are small so get one size bigger|1
Clothes can reasonably priced but it's just too busy and hardly any staff around to help.|1
Not a huge range of clothes but good customer service.|1
Like all the h&m but i found there all i wanted so it is a bigger one.|1
The staff members gathered up and talking about what he is going to be cooking tonight and everyone  (other staff) are ganged around him and laughing with each other rather than helping customers.  One lady asked for different size the worker goes it's all sold out. But soon as the lady walked away this girl in scarf said to another colleague man I can't be bothered to show her around there some more people's. Overalls there was plenty of staff but not hard workers they were useless for the customers services.|1
I been a here a few time but sadly couldn't get help from the staff|1
The music is too  loud makes it hard to shop at least  for me...Wasn't able to find the jeans I wanted and such a shame no student discount|1
1 lift for all the mummies with buggies and the staff. Not really helpful|1
Good but they need to do a lot|1
Good prices, service is none existence|1
Did not have what I was looking for. The boys section is so small.|1
Not much decent clothing in the girls range.|1
Like all H&M clothes are daily priced.|1
Nice job 👌 …|1
Great for girls clothes, not so much for boys|1
Not so organised.|1
Not my stylebut nice if you look for casual dress|1
Plain clothes and always busy. Hard to find staff|1
bad service but got a nice shirt so can't fault it|1
Better than Next and River Island|1
An alright H&M store. Staff ok, store bit smaller than other branches.|1
good|1
Ok ok collection was there|1
Quality for what you paid. Bur less size available|1
Useful for recycling|1
Not much for older ladies|1
Not a huge selection for tweens|1
Not the right shop for me|1
Not enough staff and not very helpful.|1
Did not find good deals for the children.|1
Usual hnm|1
Alway able to find something I like.|1
Just another clothing outfit. Nothing special.|1
Not anything in special on collections|1
Need to be organised and more assistant|1
Not very familiar with the shop|1
Average in amongst chain stores|1

Two floor H& M store ground floor ladies and first floor mens and children. Has decent variety of clothing for all age and gender.|1
Beautiful vibrant clothes. Clean, neat and tidy. Parking available located in Westfield Shopping centre (Stratford). Food courts  available.|1
A current fashion- house. Liked by the younger population which it serves well. Good displays and decent staff. It's a part of the Westfield complex with all its amenities.|1
I have always found this shop very reliable as well as decent fashion. I am a man, so I come in one day in search of a kimono. I found a cream coloured one that also had a price cut to £20. I bought it and it matches my style, holla at your boy, bless.|1
Large well kept store definitely one of the better h&m stores about|1
Huge selection of clothing for men, women and children, although they left the security tag on an item, not a single person to assist me when the alarm went off at the door.|1
I'm looking forward to getting my beautiful sequin dress here ear to wear for a night out out this weekend. It costs £35 and it's ridiculously gorgeous.|1
A well managed store for men and women cloth and accessories.|1
Good choice of clothes etc Staff was ok|1
Perfect time to visit this store, I would say is early morning literally within the first or second hour of opening. Store was organised and not too busy so was able to have a good look around. A large range of items across the three levels. Women's clothes dominant the store of course and you can find something to suit any budget and age. They also have a small beauty section. Store is pretty amazing carrying accessories, swimwear, lingerie, footwear, sports wear, children's wear, men's and even a small  home section. Staff on tills are friendly and really helpful with a query I had. Didn't have what I went in for (beauty item) but came out with other things I needed. Good overall store.|1
Two floor H& M store ground floor ladies and first floor mens and children.|1
Good winter collection 👌.  Reasonable price. …|1
The shop is on sales this Summer.. a good time to visit.  The counter lady was so pleasant and customer friendly.|1
Limited stuff for men and not always the best quality the but during sales you can grab a good bargain|1
Good range of summer wear. Really good prices and the quality is good too.|1
Always something wonderful and reasonably priced|1
My favourite store and is a big branch and I love the variety but once more I'll say the same thing the there's not enough staff on the shop floor to help customers.|1
Good stuff for ladies and children.|1
Picked up some things for my daughter as H&M stock a size 4 and my daughter is very slim, which is great. My only issue coming from a retail background is the staff on the tills in most shops. They always look so miserable! I understand working long hours and some customers can be quite testing, however, some of these people need to may be work on their customer service skills! Or just simple smiles would be a good start!!!|1
I've shopped at H&M since the 90s and always return for the shopping experience of space, good floor visual merchandising and great products and good prices. However the last 2 visits have been disappointing with very ordinary stock and poorer quality fabrics and choices. It seems the company is hedging oooh the safe bet with nothing interesting or quirky in stock. So I'm not purchasing as there's nothing I can't get anywhere else at equally good prices. Pity really.|1
The good the bad & ugly of shopping in H&M, 1st the good, l always find great clothes at reasonable prices 2nd the bad, you can't find any staff to help with sizes everything is really self service 3rd the ugly, l bought a suit at full price about four weeks later it had gone down to half price 🤔 l deserve a badge for sticking with H&M|1
Nice prices well stocked. Expect to queue if you need to use fitting room, one till takes cash as others card only, not over crowded.|1
Nice store. Lots of choice. Wife loves all their clothes. Great maternity selection. Love the their glass lit lift the best tho. You must check it out. Proper physechelic|1
It was nice going in there, seeing all the different things they've got. I didn't get the dress I was looking for though 😁 …|1

It is a good store. I enjoied scanning through items and I found what I needed and purchased.|1
Great for kids shopping,  i always find good stuff for my toddlers. Not much stuff for newborns though.|1
Situated in Westfield shopping centre. You will find cheap clothes|1
Just a quick pop in and out. Not to crowded and didn't find what I was looking for.  Overall it was fine.|1
My daughter got got lucky here with a pair of cut-offs from the sale rack which fit her perfectly when she tried them on. Okay ambience - less snooty and bombastic than Topshop and not frenetic and headache inducing like Westfield's Primark. My daughter didn't like shop mixtape though.|1
Its a nice shop as well where lots of collections are available although price little bit high|1
There is a lots of Hijabi tunics and dresses.|1
Nice shop clean very well laid out. Good fitting rooms. Not too busy but bought nothing feeling poor hence 4 stars.|1
Nice store not as big as expected but good|1
Needs more staff in areas but overall amazing place to shop peacefully|1
Cheap and best|1
The layout of the store is a bit confused other than that store is good enough that it has menswear and home collection.|1
Average HM store. Often lack size S in a lot of items, but still ok.|1
Always good selection of sizes in all products!  And staff always friendly & helpful!|1
Good space with good options . I love the homeware section more|1
Staff genuinely trying to be helpful but the store layout was confusing even for them.|1
Love the brand. I mostly buy my jeans here. If you want to keep up with the latest but affordable fashion; you should be shopping here.|1
Not too busy but hard social distancing in the shop which is the problem and not everyone cares about that. The shopping experience was good and lots on sale to choose from.|1
Always great to catch a look...... Homestuff is good looking!|1
Love this place always find something there i like.|1
The lights in store are very hot but a lovely shop for kids clothes great value for money|1
Lovely range of menswear on the cheaper side than some other stores nearby.|1
One of my favourite shop to buy to do shopping for my children|1
Always a good vibe in H&M good quality contemporary styles at prices that won't break the bank.|1
A small H&M but still managed to find a product and in my size.  Bear in mind, they only have one of each clothing almost in one in each size.  A very clean store.|1
Love a bit of H&M but there was not enough sleep suits  for my baby 12-18 months and or a wide range.|1
I didn't actually go in there, but I do like the shop.|1
Didn't buy anything, I just went to have a look and see what the place is about, loads of stuff some of it I would buy some I would not but that is down to taste anyway, I can't really comment on the staff and service as I had no interaction with them but the place looked alright.|1
Quite good brand and prices are reasonable, product design and qualities also good, I like the seasonal clothes especially kids clothes are   Nice subjected to heath and safety.|1
Busy but clothes are nice. Domt go during peak hours|1
Good sized store, with lots to offer.  Staff are helpful and friendly, despite it being very busy!|1
Lots of option for clothing.two floors as well|1
Good prices and not too bad clothes.|1
Great year end sales, very bright lights, many designs, I bought many kids clothing value for money..|1
I went during the sale and was pleased to find some amazing items.  Perhaps I won't have bought otherwise if not for the sale.|1
Good nail varnish selection. Love their jewelry and home section as well. They do have some good buys.|1
New location is fantastic|1
Cleanly store, perfectly priced, tasteful fashion. Same standard you would find globally. Whats not to like.|1
Clean not too crowded, friendly staff|1
Well stock, clean and tidy with tons of variety. Would defo go again. Staff are pleasant and helpful.|1
I saved £200 pounds when bought stuff on sale after Christmas! Came handy to give gifts when I went on holidays !|1
Great clothes for kids. Wish there was more choice for boys (although this applies to all other retailers too).|1
Very clean and spacious. The people work in there is helpful.|1
Awesome store, I don't like that sometimes you have to wait way to much at the lift|1
Great store, big one, find for my 11 years old daughter what she need exactly . Thanks H&M|1
Good quality clothing for reasonable prices just wish they had more midi dresses|1
Quick and helpful staff, clean shop. Still no fitting rooms...|1

Store is very big and has lots of space|1
Very pleasent experience. Staff very helpful with my query and locates my item.|1

Found some really good stuff on sale as well.|1
Looking for shirt for 14 year couldnt find his age. Also mens size small too big|1

Wait 45 minutes in the queue but great surface!|1
Sale clothing not good|1
Not a bad shop,if it's what you need you will prob get it .|1
Great sale on at the moment. Downside: clothes not laid out by sizes on the sales rack|1
Why are the mens section in the places always so small|1
Great store...|1
The quality of products is good, worth to buy it.|1
Brilliant store. Great customer services.  Helpfully staff.|1
Lots of well styled, fashionable clothing and accessories at reasonable prices.|1
Massive store at Stratford Westfield. Decent prices. Lots of items to choose from.|1
This location in Westfield is always tidy, no clothes on the ground and the staff is very helpful|1
Cheaply made clothes at cheap-ish price, like a up market primark.|1
Well stocked but no structure to what is where|1
Went in for a quick visit, had to wait round for tills to be opened.|1
Lots of choice not too busy|1
Liked this shop...it was clean and got some offer...|1
Good store. Alot of collection.|1
Quality is not good|1

Amazing fitting rooms|1
There are always dirty items (shirts, coats) whenever I am shopping there and am about to try something out.|1
Cool place. Not much in the Mens formal range|1
Good selection of clothes,  reasonable prices|1
The place is ok|1
One of My wife's favourite shopping spots|1

Very bad customer service at this store in London. If you are not in a hurry go to the H&M store at Oxford street. The guys standing at the paying counter made us go back in the line after standing for 15 minutes for no reason. He just did not look at the line and moved us back. Customer Rep or sales guy name is talal. When we brought this issue up there was an Indian/pakistani guy who was super rude with us and told us you should just break the line. I would suggest visiting better stores around with better customer support. Pathetic after spending almost 150 pounds this was not worth the treatment.|0
Terrible staff who were openly giving out about doing their jobs. No assistance with self-checkout. Didn’t see anywhere for tag removal and ended up leaving with tags on my items. Alarms went and the security guard just told us to head on. He didn’t think for a second that someone who has never done self -checkout for clothing may have left a tag on. Great stock but the staff are incompetent.|0
Really disappointed with my experience at this store today. I saw 3 very sad looking plants reduced at £3 at the “last chance” section. I thought I’d save one and get a bargain at the same time. When I went at the till the manager rudely explained these were placed there by mistake and cost £22 each. I find this extremely overpriced for a dying plant. And there was lot of other sad looking overpriced plants too. I would not recommend plant shopping from H&M.|0
I really love this shop so much however I went to return a bed set recently and was quite shocked at how rude the staff were. They said I couldn’t return it because it wasn’t in its packaging - she asked me I wanted to return it because it wasn’t the right size. I said no it didn’t suit my room and she continued to say “you should really know the size of your bed before you purchase” - first of all not what I said and second of all, SO rude? She then said I can exchange it… why is it now acceptable for an exchange and not return?|0
Seriously the MOST RUBBISH lint roller i have ever used!! Cant even tear it properly where the dotted line is. Cheap things always turned out to be more costly and makes one more angry.|0
Had NOTHING instore worth buying. Looked on EVERY level from all around the shop floor- A waste of time. Ended up going to a completely different store where some nice items of clothing were purchased.|0
Dangerously overcrowded when I went there yesterday. H&M Home Store was packed and no one was following the one way system. Children running around. Staff and security guards did not social distance from customers. Store was packed with so much merchandise and it's not even possible to walk past someone without being face to face inches away. And can't order online since lotsa stuff are out of stock in the app or online. Disappointing shopping experience all round.|0
Took forever to find a changing room that opened. The staff working in the changing room was super rude and dismissive.|0
the secutity man is very rude. i was simply asking where can i find kids corner and he looked quite annoyed. He even kinda yelled at me. I know i see the sign of kids but was so in rush just wanted to get quick help. He ruined my shopping|0
Service in women's wear was good, staff were quite helpful, however the staff up in menswear were so rude and unhelpful. Service made me feel very uncomfortable and as though the staff were being forced to work. Really disappointing considering this is one od my favourite stores. Will not be coming to this branch again.|0
Very disappointed that H&M+ has been discontinued in store and is only available online!  This is pure discrimination to women size 18+ who will now not be able to shop at your stores at all.  Disgusting!|0
Was moved on my a member of staff as I was resting (heavily pregnant with twins) told to go to the changing rooms. Terrible.|0
My experience at Stratford shopping branch of H&M started fine on the day I shopped. However, I soon realised that one garment was scanned twice and when I went back into the store to rectify the mistake. The manager made me feel as if I was lying and she looked into my face and said let me check the CCTV. She came back without any apology just''sorry for keeping you waiting i will refund your money now. Is this the same treatment given to all customers? I will not be shopping in that branch again|0
I used to love H&M and shopping online. But recently when I ordered a parcel, it was supposed to be delivered by company Yodel. It was terrible, they didn't deliver me anything, so I had to go all the way from London to Kent to take my parcel on my day off! I wasted whole day and money on the train tickets. Why this company even exists if I had to do their job? I mean, H&M was closer to me than the depot... I won't be shopping in H&M anymore until it doesn't work with this terrible company.|0
No clear signage for what floor men’s department was. Get down there and the service was so slow. Took over 10 mins to be served and I was first on line!!!|0
Loads of customers are dissappointed by yesterday's balmain event. Poorly managed staffs who totally misguided customers. I expect floods of complaint n reduce their stars to 0 bcoz this store will badly damage H&M image in long term.|0
Placed an order 2 weeks ago and i havent even received an email saying it has been posted out yet. Was told it would arrive next day delivery. After all, that is what i paid for.  AVOID AT ALL COST  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.|0
Staff not helpful. I asked at the checkout if there was another size of the item j was buying. Girly was rude asked if I looked around the store. Then said no.|0
Poor and rude customer service from staff in the menswear department on floor 1 of the H&M clothes store on Regent Street. A lot of attitude shown to not only to myself but others who were being served in all three queues. How all three staff members got jobs in customer facing roles astounds me.|0
I was in the queue on 4th floor and there was 1 lady only in the cashier. I decided to try the cashier on 3rd floor, it was closed. On the 2nd, closed. So I went back to 4th. Still one lady and when a second one came the first one left. At least 8 people in the queue. It took longer for me to pay than to find and try it on the dress I wanted.|0
"Yesterday 26 of december 2015   So hard to gave 1 star """" they need to put option of """"Mines"""" yesterday i had a shopping on the stor and i put all my shopping to the cashier .. i paid... and i want to get an other pair off shoes , i said to the cashier i will get an other one... i went i came back .. i didnt find the first pair wich i already paid..??? She was looking everywhere.. was not ther ..  cause the cashier  she is new and she is not even talk proper english .,;;;  she get an other lady to ask her for help  .. that lady said she will tcheeque the camera !!... she came back saying in the camera looks like i took the shoes..and she said she need to tcheeque in my bag !!!!! She was thing to find the shoe's in my bag  .. she is such a stupid ... i could not enderstand that .. and she had a look and no shoes was ther then its my turn to play bad words  ::: such a lier she said she saw me in camera taking the shoes and she didnt see wer is the shoes and she said the shoes is not on the store  !°¿°¿  do i have magic stupid cashier . She was  sckinny with long curly hair 😕😕😕😕😕..  dont worry i m going on holiday and when i back i will get everything sorted by lawyer..."|0
Changing rooms closed, so I'll buy elsewhere 👍 …|0
This shop sucks. I was told to leave or carry my dog (she's 22 kilos, BTW), though no sign at the entrance said so. They're just plain prejudiced, in here.|0
How can this company say they are ecofriendly and “conscious”? When they give you LARGE PLASTIC BAGS!!!! This is pure greenwashing|0
Picked up order.took longer than looking round shop for items.need to improve|0
Very bad service, nobody was willing to help me find the size I needed, some members of the staff could barely speak English and others were really rude. Disappointed.|0
Your shop hours on google say you’re open until 10pm on a Saturday but you were closed by 9:20.|0
Slowest service i have ever experienced. Really not worth visiting the store.|0
Clothes are terrible, customer service are useless and staff members needs to learn to take the sacurity tag off|0
The garments looks the same year after year.... the staff never says hi... the sizes weird... hmmm|0
"Men's Department Let me quote my boyfriend: ""When you got 5 levels, you can shove the men in the basement in only one floor, in the dark"" The layout was a disaster, I think (as a woman) there should've been broader choices for smart/formal wear. But the worst part was the darkness and NO MIRRORS. The lights were so dim, I kept seeing dark green whenever something was actually a black piece of clothing. AND YES: - NO MIRRORS. NO ACTUAL MIRRORS. Whoever was the interior designer, should get fired. They decided the columns of the building should get covered in ""mirrors"". While this works relatively good in the upper levels, in the ladies section - bright, proper classic mirror ""coloured"" mirrors there-, underground this ""mirror"" is one of those dark-grey/black reflective surfaces WHICH ALREADY CAN'T REFLECT NOTHING BECAUSE OF THE POOR LIGHTING!! And besides - even if the lights were turned on properly (what's up, saving power? why not candlelight?...!) it still isn't a plain mirror, it is this dark tinted stuff! How the hell do you expect people to see if the blue matches your eyes? ... Shame that in a world-class shopping street such blasphemy exists from H+M!! *insert here GoT shame .gif* Good day!"|0
Be careful with sales, they put full price items in between and then act like they don’t know anything.|0
Not enough for men|0
1 star for unpleasant staff. Have been here 3 times in the run up for Christmas, and they may be overworked, but been always rude. An example being: there isn't a living soul at the tills in the men's department, so you go one floor up, where they tell you, that the men's are one floor down, but in the end they do the return just the same. Another example: you queue for the till to pay, where there are three cashiers in action, then after all the waiting the till gets closed by the shop assistant right in front of you, no explanations or apologies given. Guys, this is really poor, but you'll be happy: I'll spend my money elsewhere next time.|0
Staff members lost their tongue, they can´t say hello to anyone.|0
A really poor selection of clothes in plus sizes... What a same..|0
Terrible customer service by manager on duty|0
staff here must hate their job, and it shows|0
very bad|0
Not the home store|0
To much people|0
Racist staff|0

The music is so loud I suspect they're somehow trying to keep customers away 😢 I couldn't even have a proper look around the store because it was unbearable 😕 …|0
"(Translated by Google) You are obliged to leave your things with the ""responsible"" of the fitting room and when you leave she simply loses your necklace and still blames you, as if you had lost the necklace. They should review the staff urgently!!!!!!!  (Original) Você é obrigado a deixar suas coisas com a ""responsável"" do provador e quando sai ela simplesmente perde seu colar e ainda coloca a culpa em você, como se você tivesse perdido o colar.

Ummm idk why no cloth is fully organised and you can see 8 different design of a pants in same rack… also if you want a different size the answer is no-no|0
Clothes wern't displayed in an appealing and easy to find items. Sizes were very limited and Helpers were very limited in number. I won't go there again|0
"I went to buy a bag for my Mum (xmas present) 3 weeks ago. When I went to pay for it, the cashier lady who I think had a high status in the shop (manager or something) nodded to another worker next to her as if you say ""look at this teenage girl buying this womanly bag"".I was going to say something but I was in shock. I had done nothing yet encountered such rudeness from staff for no reason ! i just looked at them but they just carried on laughing and giving each other looks. I had been to the store a few times before but after that, i'll happily spend an extra minute to walk to another h&m. They aren't the only one."|0
Music in this shop is so loud I think the staff mistook it for a disco. Had a very hard time shopping with such loud noise in the background, couldn’t hear anything. If you’ve got low noise tolerance or are on a spectrum best to avoid it.|0
I do not like shopping. Although I must say I do like that they let you charge your phone while you stop.|0
Men’s department needs improving. Went to pick up a few cheap polo necks. Had to look hard through the rail to find one without a mark on it. Thought I’d found one, got to the counter to pay and guess what.....noticed a mark on the sleeve. Cashier also left a security tag on one item so the alarm went off at the door and I had to go back inside and have them remove it.  A big store with a decent selection of the usual H&M stuff but not a great experience.|0
Store opens at 1130, but checkout counters don't open till 12.  This isn't clearly marked though.  The checkout counters are also inconveniently located.|0
Needed a carrier bag as the one I was given had broken. Was then quizzed about which items I bought before having to PURCHASE another carrier bag.|0
For a flagship store in Regent Street, it's lacking in 'customer experience' and speciality.|0

Huge store ... Different sections for all... Not well presented ... The other H&M store on oxford street is faaaaar better.|1
3 floors of affordable clothing in a spacious, clean and modern store.|1
H&M Home is alright. Busy place due to being on regent Street. Some of the staff are nice and some just can’t be bothered so they have their phone in their hand while you ask them stuff. Other than that, they open earlier on Sunday but you won’t be able to pay anything until 12pm due to their license. Don’t waste your time going around and ask to pay before 12pm they won’t do anything about it.|1
First time for me in this store, looks like they have similar good quality as Zara and mango talking about kids area, but the difference was in H&M the variety is mayor than Zara, because I find what I was looking for, after two days of searching, the only thing was my English is so bad for the employés of the store, sorry, I'm not good speaker but I'm a good buyer, but anyway things happen, after hard and ugly day I was thinking in relax myself buying some things for my little kids. But my English was good enough. I recommend you ARKET my God what a beautiful things are here.|1
Very rude staff, but a huge range of clothes.|1
Go in there when my wife is in town. Seems a large spacious, well laid out shop. Good for clothes and accessories. My wife likes it but my credit card doesn't. Joking aside seems a good shop and is always pretty busy.|1
It's a bit to big for my liking and it's all the younger trends as you enter. Younger trends should be higher up on the floors they have more energy to shop around.|1
A fine selection of clothes and accessories but I only had a few minutes to take out all in. Any shop with a dedicated floor of children's clothes really also needs a bathroom. Once we left the shopyto find one, we weren't going back.|1
I'm a fan of H&M generally but this one isn't the best laid out and in this case was all over the place in terms of customer service. It is pretty big but if you don't want to get side eye at the tills, think twice.|1
This H&M is a bit of an odd one - they are obviously trying to appeal to more the more up-market clientèle of Regents Street, so stock more smarter pieces. Unfortunately, the quality is still H&M quality (i.e. not great), so they don't really pull it off. You won't find any super trendy pieces here, but it's okay for basics or accessories.|1
Nice and warm, i go there when it rains to repair and sometimes pop in to charge my phone. Highly recommend|1
Long queues but some nice stuff, some woefully overpriced and some priced adequately.  No problems with returns.  Appears to be short-staffed as it was hard to find a sales assistant.|1
Fine for what it is. A bit messy, but understandable. Queues for paying quite long, as most cashier places were empty|1
There are millions of H&M stores in Oxford Circus, but this one is worth mentioning because it's one of the few that stocks bits and pieces from the H&M home range. Expect to find the usual H&M range across two floors, not to mention a huge queue if you shop at lunchtime.|1
H&M Regent Street is a really good store. It's a good size that there's a lot of choice available. There is also decent staff to help out. It's especially good for sales :)|1
Relatively good value for the price as it's not as expensive as Topshop for expample yet provides very similar quality clothes. On many high streets whcih is useful. Nice tees|1
To be honest I was disappointed Although it's in the middle of London they didn't have a single waistcoat...|1
With an alternative branch so nearby on Oxford Street, there seems little reason to pop into this one... except cleverly they've stocked this H&M with home wear and smarter work wear pieces that you'd don't need but think you want regardless.|1
Very good value for money, please have more wool in your jumpers , happy to pay more for better winter clothes quality|1
Lovely shop, great range of stock except for fun tights which is what I set out to purchase.|1
Hateful experience as far as shipping goes. Poorly marked areas, clothes that look and feel cheap.|1
3 floors of the latest fashions. 2 floors for ladies. The basement for men. A fair amount of choice.|1
Store was very well organized.  Staff were polite, but staff was distracted as store was quite busy.|1
A few nice products but sizes not ver inclusive at all.|1
Nice clothes as long as your small size no nice big lady  lothes at all shame|1
Pretty small on comparison to many other stores of the same chain. That comes with the disadvantage of limited choice.|1
Haiku Review! Oxford Circus drew my wife and I into here. We have too much stuff.|1
Great selection and easier to walk around no long queues.....😀 …|1
I am probably not the right person to say something about shopping stores, but there is a nice place to relax when you wife shops :)|1
Good quality stuff but I didnt find what I was looking for so 3 Stars|1
Tipical H&M shop. Good for women. Average for man|1
Fast fashion is fast fashion, cheap but not great quality|1
Good stuff within your budget..!|1
Wide variety of stuff, nothing nice|1
Big enough but can be hectic|1
Barely any men's selection|1
Too busy for my liking|1
It was ok|1

(Translated by Google) The store is big and many sellers want to help. But the store's policy of not returning money, according to them since Brexit, doesn't seem to me... and quite a bit of money could have been saved by doing so.

One of the best H&M stores there is. Smart, well stocked, clean, and vibrant, modern design with a huge display wall at the back. Men’s is on the upper level.|1
Nice big shop, lots of clothing available. Went on self checkout, no issues.|1
One of the largest H&M Stores in London and perhaps the only one with the largest section dedicated to kidswear and maternity wear. I love buying children's clothes from here especially the colours for boys are so vibrant! Sleepwear used to be great too but, now the styles have become a bit boring! The reason for 4 stars is because this year the styles are quite dull and drab which could be due to post-lockdown effect, not sure, but pretty disappointing. The queue in the women's fitting room can get busy on the ground floor. The accessories section is good as well but not as good as the branch in Oxford street. Definitely a great place for kidswear. Hope they can bring back the great styles.....|1
very good customer service , i used to work for h and m and service was great|1
Huge branch located right next to Oxford Circus underground.  Loads of floors.  Generally well laid out.  Very nice and bright, welcoming.  Never 'looks' busy as it's so big and spacious.  Staff are pleasant.  I don't often shop at H&M but tend to browse now and again like I did today.  Cheap and quality is fine.  They have some nice things.  Would recommend.|1
Bought outfits from their sale selection|1
Team are fantastic and the layout is easy to understand and find items you're looking for. Their selection is good, store is clean. Only downside is the amount of teams on tills, always one or two and always have to wait 10 mins to be served. Worth it though|1
Big and spacious with a variety of clothes, shoes and accessories. Music playing and a few seating areas on second floor. :)|1
Bright and spacious store with lots of stock! Didn't have xxl size in many mens basic joggers though - as stated on website!|1
I come to this branch for the kids wear. It is usually organised and neat and I normally find great, stylish stuff for my little ones. This branch also has a home section with such lovely items. Staff are helpful and hard working and queues move quite quickly if they build up. This branch is located on regent Street which has some more expensive stores and so it's like a breath of fresh air having an H & M on that line up !|1
Affordable fashion across clothing, lingerie, shoes and accessories. I particularly like this branch as it is  well stocked and surprisingly has ĺess footfall than you would expect given the location, doesn't get crowded out, though you can't say the same for the street outside, always super busy.|1
This is a great store over several floors right next to Oxford Circus. A bit hit and miss for the larger sizes but great product ranges.|1
Out of the 3 stores within walking distance this is the only one that has kids clothing.  Easy store to navigate around and prices are moderate. Quality of materials is excellent and the designs are inspiring.  Staff are helpful.|1
I love their socks, but I wish they did then in a bigger size, they shrink after a couple washes. There was also a problem when purchasing the socks as the cashier didnt apply the 3 for 2 deal, but it's a great shop and ill be returning for more socks|1
Nice little store with a wide range of clothing to choose from. It can get quite busy at times so I would recommend doing your shopping in the morning.|1
Due to the size of the store and it nice staff you will not be disappointed.|1
I'm from the States so we have a lot of H&Ms but these ones have so much more! They are massive and have so many clothes to choose from. I find that they have some different stuff here as well. I dont necessarily like to shop at places that i have at home but because this is so afffordable I figured why not look? I plan on doing a lot more shopping at H&M because I know that I wont be able to get some of the clothes over in the US.|1
Popped in to check out the children's clothes in the sale this week and got some great bargains. The store was relatively tidy considering it was sale time and the prices were comparable with Primark - which is most people's 'go to' place for cheap fashion.|1
Good quality denim shirts and jeans at a reasonable price, and the staff are really helpful.....|1
Just a stone's throw from their store on Oxford Circus, but this one is far superior. It is much bigger and consequently has a much better range of clothing. For guys – look out for their collaborations with big name designers. Whilst the girls are queueing outside to get in, we can go straight upstairs and check out the men's section :)|1
The H&m store is reat and have a very good quality. the childrens cloths are fantastic, very good quality and my children love it very much. there should be more sales prices and somethimes there are diffrences between the stores. the prices are usually ok. i had a problem with the service at the H & M store at the Oxford street. the appeal is not so good|1
Always a good place to shop|1
The fast fashion is definitely upping its game in terms of quality and prices are reasonable|1
H&M was a wonderful store.  They have a great location that is convenient from the Tube.  There is not much men's clothes compared to women.  Prices seem reasonable for London|1
Good value for money, not very busy and many trial rooms available.|1
Wide range of womens, mens, childrenswear and homewares at affordable prices. Can get a bit crowded and untidy at sale times and changing rooms are closed during sale.|1
At the moment it is the only H&M store with plus size H&M+ in Central London and the selection of clothes is not very extensive. I´d appreciate if H&M had a plus size store locator because it is quite difficult to find them|1
Good sale deals and nice clothes for men. The only downside is that the largest shoes size for men is 45.|1
Classy yet affordable|1
Love it, H&M flagship store, but music is unnecessary in my view. Also, not many shoes. Where's all the shoes?|1
Some of staff are so lovely and helpful others are just plain arrogant and rude. However, love the products, hence I keep coming back.|1
Stumbled over the pleat cafe in the home department. Great coffee and hot chocolate, but only 6 tables so very cosy.|1
H&M is a great shop for cheap good quality clothes. It's very nicely priced. Perfect location in London and aways busy.|1
"I like this H&M. There are a lot of sections, also a curvy one. But the selection of ""plus size"" pieces is not the best."|1
Clean and spacious shop. Here you can make a bargain|1
They have great styles and nice prices|1
This store, it's my jam. It's one of he biggest H&Ms in London and has lots of items in stock before some of the other stores. My only issue is that I may not find what I'm looking for when I pop in even if they have new stock weekly. The staff are usually okay.|1
They don't always have all the sizes. Not the biggest choice for shoes and accessories but it is always less busy than the Oxford Street one.|1
A very large H&M store in a very busy part of london. It can get very busy during peak times, however it will have what you want.|1
Very nice specially when there's sale Like today the report price quality is very good|1
Good variety of clothes, shoes, etc. Affordable prices|1
Busy but cool place to visit ,plenty of shopping for the granddaughters.|1
Great bargains to be had, needs to pay more attention to offer more larger sizing choices, fit and at times better quality.|1
Best h&m i've been to - the staff were helpful, no attitude, the clothes were well stocked and the store was very tidy|1
I had a pleasant experience visiting this Swedish warehouse|1
Nice selection of clothing at good prices|1
Large variety of options and much easier than the Oxford Circus outlet which gets a lot busier.|1
Great home store with reasonable prices. Quality is ok.|1
H&M finally!! Had options to buy for kids....I had been to atleast 5 retailers before that and all of them had very poor choices for kids|1
Nice collection, latest trends, affordable pricing..gr8 discounts if you are lucky|1
Good sales! I bought some really nice trousers for 20 pounds|1
Fair enough prize for good quality|1
They don't have a Home section or a very big sportswear section.|1
Great for picking up essentials and everyday clothes and accessories for men and women|1
Love this shop nice variety of clothes for children's and adults|1
Clean, lots of lovely things ! Well spread out, fab|1
Pretty clean. Not a good range of clothes|1
i like hm. a bit of everything to suits different sex and ages but limited kids stock|1
Partner and I went into 2 other H&M stores for a particular item and was told that item was no-longer in stock in any of the stores. Was even told by a staff in this store on the ground floor that it maybe out of stock but it would be on the 2nd floor if they had any left. Asked a really friendly Italian gent. Who not only knew what she wanted but where. Back on the ground floor near where the other staff member had been working. So thank you to him and your 4 is yours alone. Should have been 5 but your colleagues let you down.|1
Great place with amazing collections.|1
Nice and spacious, not too crowded.|1
H&M have decent clothing for men and women. Pricing is good.|1

Nice open place on 3 floors|1
Great offers!|1
Good outfits, well managed|1
I prefer this one to the Westfield in Stratford.|1

I shopped in the Regent Street H&M Home last night. I was a bit lost with where to find certain items I had seen online. I asked a sales associate for some help. I was looking for a certain candle which was not found in store. However, Rachel advised me that she would go downstairs and check the Stockroom to try and find these for me. as she was heading off the sales floor, another lady I believe to be the manager in charge asked where was she was going, Rachel replied “to find some candles for this gentlemen, the Green dinner candles” of which the manager in my opinion wasn’t best pleased she was leaving the floor and simply said  “erm may be” (kind of eye rolling) Anyway, Rachel found my products which were sold out online and not available on the shop-floor she gave me two of them as I requested which made me very happy. Rachel also helped me to find several other items within the store that I wasn’t able to. Rachel also served me at the till point making sure I knew about my H&M app and even showed me where I could save £3 in vouchers that I didn’t know I had towards my sale. Honestly, it’s not mentioned enough when you get a good service in stores people tend to just focus on the negative. Rachel is a credit to that store and had she not of been there I would’ve walked out empty-handed. She is a breath of fresh air in a very busy retail environment but she made time for me and made me feel I was a valued customer and friend. Well done Rachel!! I’ll be back that’s for sure!!|1
Flagship store so it looked great.  Large screens playing some cool effects.  Store was tidy and well kept despite the heavy traffic.  There was a lego rep for Xmas handing out free lego and a small station for kids to make little bits.  Overall a great experience at the store. Thanks.|1
Pal is an amazing stylist and has great attention to detail. My experience was enhanced mostly because of the care with which all the options were presented to me. Amazing concept by H&M!|1
We really enjoyed our visit to H&M Home... we found amazing stuff wich will fit great our kitchen... so excited Well done 😊😊😊 …|1
This H & M have can buy baby clothes Location in London Oxford Street opposites of apple Store. Very good to shopping.|1
A new experience .. you can now rent your evening dress and the prices are crazy low . . Check it out such a cool experience|1
I love the displays but they were little short of men's winter clothing|1
Nice collections at a great location as usual clothing at h and m is of good quality. Huge shop with a lot of space and great ambience for a cloth store.|1
Kids floor is excellent, welcoming and interactive ♥️|1
H&M is a amazing clothing shop, my daughter worked as shop assistant here for many years during the school time, and she had some massive discount! They have very decent quality stuff (better than Primark) and at a just slightly more expensive prices. If you never visit this Swedish multinational, you should!!|1
The staff in kids area is so kindle|1
This H&M isn't huge but it's a decent size... considering there is another 3 H&M stores within a few minutes of this one. There's a reason why H&M is so successful and this store is a testament of their success. Great staff, great products and even though I went in to get something small I didn't have to wait long in the queue. Brilliant!|1
I will be brief, I know what it is to work with the public and more in a store like H&M, and the other day I was amazed at the treatment of a portuguese girl, she was blonde, about 30-40 years old, she attended me with a sweetness and delicacy that reminded me why I work in what I work, I go many times, and I don't have a single complaint (maybe in the oxford circus if I would), but here I just say that all of you are wonderful, thank you portuguese girl, you are great.|1
Many beautiful things, with a good price and Natasha was super helpful in the fitting room. Definitely the best H&M customer service in London.|1
Itself, the store is very well merchandised and stocked. Staff as well, have always been very friendly, approachable and helpful, without being pushy. Particular shout-out to Steven (Stephen?) who helped me with reserving many cushions over at the Shepherd's Bush store. Dream team!|1
thanks for the good and polite communication with customers, the attitude is at the highest level, the quality is good, the choice is wide|1
This has become my favourite home, decor and interior store. It's also got a lovely cafe you can get pastries, hot pasta and sandwiches,  beverages and more. Love the florist in corner of the store.|1
Very beautiful interior decor with a very attractive display of items. Roaming is easy inside. Prices are very fair and affordable. Staff are a few however so expect searching for one when you need help. It is very clean and well taken care of.|1
This shop is observing social distancing beautifully. This allowed me to feel safe whilst shopping here. The store is located on Regents Street and has just reopened to the public.  I have often walked passed this site and could not wait until they opened so I could browse around the store and see the home furnishings they sold.  Wow, this shop is like walking into an Aladdin's cave of home furnishings. Once it draws you in you found yourself being wowed by the imaginative and beautiful way they display their goods. At times I felt I was walking into a royal kitchen (almost expecting a butler is be coming around the corner to ask what we are doing in this part of the house).  The store is over two floors and sells artistic but practical home items for most rooms around the house at astonishingly competitive prices.  I recommend this store for people who want to give their house of flat a tasteful but original touch. Out of you want to buy that special gift.|1
H&M is gradually becoming my favourite place for shopping. I know it's a chain, but I love it anyway. Their coats and jackets are great, as well as the skirts and even the swimwear. Nice location, clean store, friendly and helpful staff.|1
I am so in love with H&M Home. Wonderful ideas to help you turn your home into somewhere stylish and special. Without it looking like an 'IKEA' home - if you get my meaning. Going back again soon.|1
One of my Favourite stores you can sort the whole family out in one place at a really great price ....  Like the outfits like the one I'm wearing... @h&m|1
The staff were great. They answered all of my questions and offered suggestions for things I couldn't find. The queues can be a little long, but they do go quickly. This is a very busy part of London so it's not surprising that this store and those surrounding it would be busy quite often.|1
Lovely and spacious store where you find what you need at good prices.|1
International brand name store selling cloths especially for young people.|1
Late evening. Not so overcrowded|1
Very polite staff and good choice of merchandise|1
I've just received some amazing customer service from Ruby and wanted to share - thank you! Very happy customer 😊 …|1
H&M store is next to Piccadilly Circus underground station. The store is divided into different sections. The basement consists of men clothing. The ground floor and upper floors has women and children clothing. You can find latest trendy as well as formal dresses here, including shirts, t-shirts, trousers, coats, jackets, tops, jeans and party wears. The staff is user friendly. You can also use one4all gift card. The store also has its own card.|1
Cool store! Lots of floors to buy your products - but only a small portion of mens clothes. Escalators were a little confusing on the top floor (noticed a lot of people were going the wrong way)|1
I find this to be a really good branch of H&M with its recent launch of H&M studio line in store. A good selection of the more trend lead pieces can be found here, as well as accessories, shoes, kids and men's. No homeware here, there is a section in the store on Oxford street which has the homeware.|1
I went today to H&M regent street I was served by the guy called DAREEN I want to express his excellent customer service I’ve had with him he’s absolutely amazing worker thank you so much Dareen and hope to meet people just like you 👌👌 …|1
Wow what a big h & m. So many floors and so much to see, I was very impressed. Well organised and covid secure.|1
Always find something I like at this store. Super big with lots to choose from. Lovely organic cotton basics too. Often have great scarves too (can be used as hijabs)|1
I love this place as the clothes are quality and you can wash them over and over again without colour faded or shrinking|1
Nice linen blend casual wear pants and best price 😘😘😘 …|1
You can often find those sold out one offs here. Worth a look.|1
There was really good stuff and our family loved it, it had many stuff on sale that were very cheap and useful.We spend 3 hours looking around and buying stuff!|1
Good selection of high quality clothes and great prices. Good for kids wear too.|1
Found an outfit for my daughter's Halloween party but a few hours of walking I wanted to stop but your store was last on my list I was determined to get an outfit that day. Thanks for that.|1
Very good! H&M always have nice products and always change|1
Great customer service|1
Not too long queue and very well maintained during this time.|1
Large, tidy, well spaced out. Feel bad for the chaps as their section is so much smaller than the ladies. Staff are mostly professional.|1
Nice store, pretty spacious. Never managed to get stuck in its rush hour so it seems pretty quiet to me. Nice product for an affordable price|1
very cool store, excellent service, help and advice|1
Friendly staff and has more variety to pick and buy.|1
Nice 😍 …|1

Much better than Other HNM around the world|1

I loved these pants like loved them. I literally wore them a few times and just purchased them a month ago. But this morning when i already had my jeans on and ready to go I bent down to grab something and they ripped right by the pocket. I tried calling customer service but they said it would be difficult to do an exchange because i didn’t have any tags(but i have the receipt). So yeah I won’t be purchasing these or any of these again.|0
It’s a Sweden brand, which we boycott because their racist double standard government they let extremist burn the holy book|0
Only 2 cashiers working in the busiest time of the year. ABSURD|0
Had an unfortunate experience. Bought three pieces of boxer shorts for the price of two. One of the pieces of clothing was damaged when I opened the box, and I obviously wanted to change that pair for a new one. However I had to pay some dollars to get a new pair of shorts.|0
I bought a shirt that said it was supposed to be 12.99 but the total came to 18.04 and it said I bought 2 items but I only bought 1|0
Actually bad customer experience. Wont spend time and money here. I know customers are a lot today but that should not be not an excuse.|0
Worst experience. Never visit. Anthony the manager is so disrespectful and abusive.|0
I want to know why you have 2 floors, ample men's clothing, ample women's clothing, a section for accessories, even a housewares section. But 0 plus size options. It's really overdue for mainstream retailers to be inclusive. I don't need to try on a duvet cover, I do need to try on clothes that fit my body. I shouldn't have to explain to a global retailer in 2019 how awful it is to be having a fun shopping day with your friends on Newbury Street and need to sit out when they hit your store just because you're not the same size as your friends.|0
This store's manager is the most impolite employee I've met at H&M. He treats customers like garbage; as if he were doing a favor to them|0
Yesterday 10/21 around 11am I had a bad encounter with a sales associate/supervisor working the fitting room. I had several garments including a hat, to match an outfit I was considering in purchasing. Associate stated I was not allowed to go into the fitting room with the hat to try on, not knowing I previously worked at H&M and know the fitting room policy. So I asked him how would I be able to try on the hat with the outfit then, he stated I can go in the fitting room put on the garments I want to try on then call him and he will bring the hat, then take the hat back. Which did not make any sense. Later after I purchased the hat he didn’t allow me to try on, I informed him I previously worked at H&M and know that you are allowed to go into the fitting room to try on hats with out being monitored, I had ask to speak to a supervisor to make a complaint not knowing he was actually the supervisor on shift. Sales associates including supervisors should never profile a customer like that as you can lose sales. Yes I looked young and I am African descent doesn’t mean I plan to steal a $12.99 hat. Which everyone knows anything over $9.99 has sensors on them. He told me if I still have an issue just call customer service to make a complaint and have a nice day (sarcastically). Employees like that should be addressed and properly trained on discrimination and customer service skills.|0
You mean to tell me i can go to Braintree with less selection than a flagship location and find just what i need? Horrible service hot and not shopable. Clothes on the floor and customer service is -100. I hear the emplyees complain about how they hate it there and cant wait to leave. Obviously they need more people that loves there job. And can help me find a basic shirt without having to ask 10 different people. Gotta love low budget fashion|0
Horrible Experince! The lady at the fitting room was so awful and mean. I had over seven items and she said that I would have to try on the rest of the items later which I was completely okay with. Later I was underdressed so I politely asked if she could hand me the other items in exchnage for the items I had already tried on, she looked at me and said that I would have to come out and get them myself! I was liteally five steps away from her! Later when I stepped out to get my stuff, she asked how many items I had I said six and she would not believe me so she made me, so she counted all the items herself. I feel offended and never had such an expereince at H&M.|0
-Collection of clothes is [personally] not pleasing. -The layout of things makes it difficult to move around. -Employees could not found anywhere when their help was needed.|0
Rude staff, pathetic collection, over priced|0
While purchasing a white hoodie the cashier dragged it on the counter top so now theres blue pen marks on the back ...........|0
Inefficient stuff, the female manager is extremely unhelpful with the refund issue,  super disorganized store management|0
You should really provide a toilet for consumers.|0
Very slow customer service Store is a mess !!|0
They suppose to close at 8:00 pm on Sunday and I went to the store about 7:00 pm and the security guy told me they were already closed|0
I was seriously disrespected by a male employee. Better to just order online|0
No chairs in that place.|0
Rude staff, bad quality of clothes. Keep away|0
They always open the doors late!!|0
Stupid and disrespectful employee|0
Look for another H&M 😐 …|0
They offer horrible service. They can’t refund with Apple Pay and the guy told me to get a temporary physical card from the Apple Store. But the guy lied because Apple Store doesn’t have such service. I will never buy anything from the H&M.|0
Store manager assume costumers as liar|0
(Translated by Google) Lack of a lot of items and extremely unpleasant sellers  (Original) Manque de pas mal d’articles et vendeurs extrêmement désagréable|0
They need to hang their long coats/dresses somewhere higher…. This is gross. Buyers, beware if purchasing long items like these. Otherwise, it is a decent H&M with a large selection of items, and a great team of employees.|0
This place has a really good collection on a random day and no good collection at all on other days. Considering that this place is always crowded and billing line is always huge, they don’t have staff on the first floor for billing ok weekdays which makes it look like it is crowded all the time|0
Long wait in line even with 4 registers open. Same as Zara down the street. Be prepared to wait. The mostly Gen Z workers just move extremely slow and unmotivated. Asked for a bag, she forgot to give me one, and then bowed to me Buddhist style and got it passive aggressively. Weirdest interaction I've ever had in a store.|0
"Extremely rude and unhelpful staff working in the fitting rooms. Also, it's impossible to go there with friends to see wheather things look good on them or not because ""it's not allowed to go into the fitting rooms area"", which is weird coz it's allowed in pretty much every single HnM I've ever been to."|0
Only went in here for a few men's tees. It was so crowded you could hardly move and huge lines for the fitting rooms.  Clothing racks are over-flowing and crowd the entire store, so not much room to move through the store, so good for a quick in-out visit, but wouldn't be very relaxing to actually browse around.  Got the tee's we needed though.|0
Sure it's big, and has a great range, but the floor service was dismissive and unhelpful, and the checkout service was appallingly slow, and the girl just stuffed the clothes into a bag without even folding them. But to be honest she was much more interested in joining her colleagues in conversation about anything but what was happening in the store. H&M needs a secret shopper to kick the backsides of these lazy staff and protect the brand.|0
Chronically understaffed and extremely hot and humid. I almost passed out waiting in line to check out.|0
If you need clothes that are moderately overpriced, this is a fine choice. But generally the culture and values that they project seem to emerge from this sad combination of mindless fashion, body shaming and copratism. And one can only assume that any money you spend there will go towards advancing those unfortunate values.|0
I like this store because they have children cloth, but I had several problems here, like they left the alarm tag on several times and they didn't put all the items in the bag (that happened to me twice, once I paid for a shirt which wasn't in the bag and another time I thought I'd bought  a shirt, which wasn't in the bag when I got home... so many mistakes here!|0
It was crowded. The place was a disaster and the workers were stuck up and rude.|0
The selections are amazing but the customer service is horrible. Everyone acts as if they have something better to do than assist customers|0
So sad Mens collections are very (Gappy) So generic. Repeat repeat.  So Gap. Please bring fashion back. Forward, trends, and design.😫😫😫😫😪😪😪😪😪😪🤞🤞🤞 …|0
Never enough fitting rooms, men selection is sparse as hell|0
Associate  at check out , seem , not interested. No thank you , nothing!|0
The men’s options here is really small|0
Messy organization. Limited variety of sizes and products. Bad service|0
No real method to where things are placed..2 floors of disorganization|0
Sales associate not aware of actual discounts|0
Nice price but racist employee|0
Mediocre, expensive clothing.|0
Expensive|0
What a mess...|0
Junky|0
Just heads up they don’t do price match so if you’re looking for something in store might have to go somewhere else or order online|1
Visited to see some home decors in H&M and this only has very limited options. You cannot find lots of varieties, however, what they have is really beautiful.  Can find payed parking around the building for 2 hour from Mon to Sat(Sunday is free).|1
Hnm is the main location for work clothes and business casual clothes.  However it seems like they have less and less clothes out. There's usually only 1 maybe 2 registers open so be prepared to wait. That goes for downstairs as well. They have a huge children's section but for women good luck trying to find your size. Still a great store to find clothing but its more like a needle in the haystack.  I wish they never closed the downtown location.  That location made sure to have a wide range of items and don't bother trying Cambridge location they don't have much either.|1
Just a regular h&m, a little bit messy. Nice but not enough employees, long queue.|1
I think the clothes is good, but the pants are way too long and the petite size is only available over the website. I ask this girl and notice that they do help the guests but have this kind of rude attitude. Even though I love the clothes, not too much luck for me in this occasion. COVID safety: everyone wears a face mask (staff and guests), didn't see any signs of bathroom open or antibacterial available.|1
They had a decent selection of clothes for both men and women in terms of styles and pieces but they dont have a good size range on the plus size end. The biggest size they have in shirts is 14 which, while fitting in some areas.. didn't fit in other areas (intentionally vague). Store is two story and the staff is friendly but don't always take the initiative to ask if you need help. This is not always a bad thing as sometimes you want to peruse without having to talk to anyone.|1
Clothes are alright quality for the price, some articles are more fairly priced than others, some are just awful quality. Gotta try stuff on! Overall a ton of inventory to choose from. Checkout and dressing room lines tend to be long and move slow, depends on which employees are working and what hour of day you go.|1
The store has a great selection of clothes at a high price though. The colors are not exactly unique in their range of avalibtes. Although their clothing patches are fun and cute. Their range of accesories are low to midrange at best.|1
The store had a lot of clothing to look at however the racks were really close together making it very had to move around in the store. The fitting room on the top floor had a huge line. The fitting room on the ground level had no one in it.|1
This is a fantastic location.  Much better than the dwntwn xing store.  The threads are still  young and hip but the store grew up.|1
It's hit or miss with location. The lines' current season of fashion are kind of mediocre. Cambridge Side has better sales.|1
Women's, men's, children's clothing styles. Many very good looks. Housewares too! Very surprising variety.|1
It's ok..just know what your looking for and you'll be fine.|1
I like of these stores, but this one in Boston expose the clothes with wrong prices for our surprise at the register.|1
The lighting was great, those boston prices not so much.|1
Very clean and packed clothing store. Has entrances from both Newbury and Boylston st|1
It is always difficult to find what you are looking for. Probably the fashion is limited and does not get rotated that much...|1
Good for what it is. They try to shove a little too much into the space they have though.|1
Not much customer service and the staff don't really know their stuff.|1
They seldom have enough folks working behind the registers so the lines are super long.|1
Good products considering price. Abismal customer service|1
Quality of clothing has definitely changed.|1
I've seen better stores, but it's Okey.|1
Always crowded.  But nice clothes.|1
Shopping average quality for reasonable prices|1
It's got clothes. The shelves are a mess|1
There were not too much variety...|1
Great variety|1
Lines moved a bit slow when I was there.|1
Too small of selection for men|1
Staff are pretty unfriendly.|1
Large but somewhat disorganized|1
No athletic clothes.|1
Good H&M|1
Cheap European diggs!|1
Messy and a little dirty.|1
Just another H&M|1
Helpful staff|1
Standard and standard|1
It's retail on Newbury Street.|1

I'll find a lot of good deals on sale. There is a wide collection of merchandise including formal wear.|1
H & M has just what you need if you are into the 2000s aesthetic or need practical clothing. Although, the quality is not great. This store is great for new trends but it doesn’t last a long time.|1
Nice kid's clothes selection|1
I love the location. The prices are great.  The selection for plain Ts and the basics is all the same. But I prefer the Men’s wider selection at the H&M at the Cambridgeside Galleria.|1
The men's selection is small, but what is there is well organized and there's a good clearance section|1
I feel like the target-demographic has gotten younger based off the clothing available. There used to be more professional options in the women's section, especially, now everything seems to skew younger (teen, possibly undergrad college). I feel like the men's side is better stocked for a young professional than the women's side, which I'm disappointed about.|1
Lots of stuff my kids wanted... dressing rooms were packed!|1
Good place to buy clothes|1
This place is usually packed. Clothing is mostly in place and nicely grouped in their proper sections so it's not terribly hard to find things. What you see on the floor, as I'm told by the employees is everything they have so if you don't see your size you're generally out of luck.|1
H&M I like this store/chain. Decent clothing, good prices, usually lots of color. And a colorful place, too. Unfortunately for me, I have expanded beyond their size range. I still think you should check in..|1
A little disorganized but overall decent|1
Always love an H & M.! Can always find something that strikes my fancy and won't even scratch the surface financially. More importantly, service is good. There is never a long wait. Thanks H & M!|1
Good deals with blouses. I went in to check out their fitted blazers but they were a little oddly shaped though the suits said petite ( I'm a petite person).|1
Love the home department, just wish there was a larger selection|1
A pretty decent H&M. There are two floors, mens in the first floor and womens and kids in the second floor. The sales here are pretty subpar, and the racks tend to get pretty messy during the busy hours. Try to come early to beat the crowds, or you'll have to wait in line for at least 20 minutes to try on clothes, and then to purchase them.|1
It's a big H&M with a lot of concepts. Modern Classic, Divided, Everyday, Kids, Conscious Collection, Trend, Men's, and even Home... And they will defintely stock special collections when they come out. I'm probably missing some since I don't really shop there anymore but if you're an H&M fan, you'll love this store.|1
Even though this is a somewhat large store, the staff usually does a decent job at keeping it tidy. There are far too many racks and tables jammed into the space, so navigation can be a hassle, but the sale section can't be beat.|1
Great selection, but long checkout lines|1
I’m not a particular fan of H&M, but I do find something worthwhile from time to time. This H&M is the largest I have seen to date and has a massive selection. Definitely worth stopping in if you have the chance.|1
Love the size of the store ! It contains way more than a normal store has and it has a huge men's and home section. The only downside is the long lines at the cashier; they never seem to have enough staff available.|1
Good place to get all you need for your home and clothing|1
I like the selection they have here and the deal are great. the custmer service is ok. I wish they would be more welcoming when you enter the store or something. Its cool though|1
Great options for cute clothes! Really good prices. Certain racks are really crowded so it's hard to get clothes off of them|1
It is comfortable to do clothing 3shopping because the store is spacious and has plenty of products. But H&M HOME doesn't has much products.|1
It's small for an H&M and the selection isn't that great but it's still a good store and they have some amazing deals from time to time.|1
One of the bigger H&M stores.|1
Large selection of clothes. Mens in the first floor and womens and H&M home on the 2nd floor. Surprised to find that there is a H&M home section.|1
Great clothes but busy lines! People are not social distancing on a busy Sunday afternoon there|1
This is a huge store and usually in decent shape. (Far better than the downtown location) The Home and Men collection both worth a visit.|1
Some good 100% cotton quality tops and I like their recycling old clothes to get discount program|1
Great selection of essentials, good if you need a quick closet update or you want a trendy piece for a cheap price.|1
Cheap and best.. good clothing options.. collection of formal wear although not so great!|1
Awesome store! Can find fast fashion pieces at a good price.|1
Somewhat clean and very claustrophobic. Well organized store. Friendly employees. Great service.|1
Great clothes, great prices, excellent location. However, not very well organized|1
Good selection and great location|1
Two stories gives room for a lot of clothing options. And they have home goods at this store as well.|1
Nice branch. a big selection and it has a home department which is nice. Good location as well.|1
Good selection but it's over picked so you won't find much late in the season.|1
Affordable European style. The store is usually organized so is easy to find what you are looking for!|1
Newly renovated two floor store. Always packed so be prepared to wait in line.|1
Smaller than normal store, but very helpful staff|1
Nice store, clothes were reasonably priced|1
Has amazing collection. Sales are must visit.|1
Staff is quite rude .... Cambridgeside h&m staff is far more helpful and courteous.|1
Good basics! Also love the accessories. Nice salespeople.|1
Great place to pick up socks underwear a cool sweater|1
Large store with multiple levels. Very clean, no bathrooms for public although.|1
Decent deals and a full room of H&M Men selections!|1

Good selection, update collections. Although weekends can be messy .|1
Flagship store,  friendly staff,  large selection for great prices.|1
Standard H&M store, big selection plus H&M Home line.|1
You can bring clothes there or fabric and get a 15% discount.|1
Great selection of women's clothing.|1
The only average shop in this street, well equipped.|1
You can find great sales here!|1
Love the clothes, good price!|1
Good location. Decent clothes|1
Unlogic placement of goods, but if  you have more time you can find there something for you|1
Large H&M with good collection and friendly staff.|1
They have something for everyone. Inexpensive.|1
This store has H&M kids and H&M home as well.|1

aesthetically pleasing and i personally love the vibe of the store. there’s cute clothes there but most of the clothes for the chilly season are overpriced.|1
It is an nice place for shopping. The prices are very reasonable and some are very cheaper. I bought a Jacket for 10.99 and the original price was around 200.00|1
Stylish items for affordable pricing. Repeat customer.|1
Always like this location, it's perfect spot, staff always nice and helpful|1
Very clean, beautiful. The 2022 collection there now is very clean lines and focused on shades of grays, beige, black|1
I wish I visited H&M more often. Pretty nice collection. I recommend buying tshirts from here, but not jeans or shoes.|1
Fairly affordable clothing that keeps up with style and quality. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The store keeps up a sustainable mindset as well, often giving out discounts for staying sustainable. The layout of the store is fairly open and well organized, making for an easy way to find the clothing that you need.|1
I'm not much of a shopper, but I like this store. Nice, casually fashionable stuff at a good price.  A great selection of children's clothing on the second floor.|1
Really good time. Loved the two girlies in the front. Caught an employee lackin'. Copped some really good clothes. 5/5|1
Very large selection of hm clothing, I've never seen so many clothes at one store, I didn't even know they had an hm home section.|1
I love this location because they always have a lot of variety and the store is kept in pristine condition being in a downtown location. I can find dressy clothes, business clothes, casual stuff, accessories, and even bikinis here. This is my favorite HM to visit around Boston where I live so it must be the best!|1
I mean, let's just say my entire wardrobe is from H&M. I go shopping here seasonally dressed like I own the place, and I have customers approach me for help thinking I work there. Fortunately, I'm knowledgeable on styles and colors currently on trend at the different locations. Excellent staff. Professional service and simply great sty!  [Excellent men collection.]|1
Downtown Boston. Very nice store. Clothing for the younger generation.|1
This is a great place to get needed clothing for cheap. In October, I needed to get a pair of black shorts for work. It was hot outside and the Fall clothing was in season.  However, they still had some inventory for the Summer left, and it was convenient that I didn't have to sweat my tomatoes off wearing black pants on a hot and humid day.  While there, it was nice to see that they give discounts for returning used clothing back to them in an effort to recycle. The impact that this has on our environment and the effort that H & M takes to give this opportunity makes me more cognizant of buying their stuff.  I will say, it tends to look fashionable, not Derelict-y enough but there is always a slight consideration to buy their stuff. The recycling they offer and the discount because of bringing in their used clothing is important in my consideration.  Always clean and friendly, expect a greeter at the door and at least a few people in front of you at the register, but you will get out fast enough, its fast fashion, after all!|1
"This was a whirlwind of a shopping trip.  I went shopping the Sunday of the black friday weekend found three pairs of pants, a shirt and a cardigan. When I went to be rung up, they told me that if I brought in a bag of clothes to donate they would take an extra 15% off.  It just so happened that I had a bag of clothes to donate back in my car in Cambridge.  The cashier offered to hold my items while I got my clothes to donate.  Before leaving I asked the cashier what time they closed and she replied ""9 or 10. I don't remember"". So I went home, did some errands, ate dinner and grabbed the bag of clothes. At this point it was 7:40.  When I looked up driving directions back to the store, I saw that the cashier was mistaken and the store closes at 8 PM on Sundays.  After quickly driving over to back bay and I arrived at the store at 8:00 PM on the dot. The cashier who told me they closed at 9 or 10 was actually at the door and was initially not going to let me in.  She then remembered me and said she'd talk to her manager. Her manager, Kingston, was amazing. He came over, let me in, took me to the register, called over his coworker Jade to help me and gave me 15% off for my clothes donation.  Jade was also quite pleasant and helpful.  Kingston and Jade, you were absolutely wonderful and turned the whole experience around for me.  Cashier who's name I did not catch, everybody makes mistakes. Thanks for helping me."|1
I enjoy shopping in this store. Friendly and warm staff, lots of options, a very organised store despite heavy traffic. I enjoy shopping here! A must visit for casual wear!|1
most comfortable pants in khaki on sale for $15. I also got a navy knit dress that will look good when I lose some weight around my inner tube. I also like some of the bags. I will now be taken more serious by other people for wearing these pants and the khaki top. I bought a green jacket here for $10 a thick jacket to wear in winter in dark green satin|1
"Great selection! Friendly staff! Awesome Location! I couldn't of asked for anything more! I've been to some H & M stores where you can't help but wonder.. ""why do I even bother to shop here?""... bc the customer service is sooo BAD. But this (Thank God) was not the case! One of the best shopping experiences I've had at H& M thus far and I'm happy to say I will be coming back!"|1
I love H&M they are amazing when it comes to trends and fast fashion. The only thing that continues to concern me is the ethics of the business. Are workers around the world provided a safe work environment and a living wage?|1
Good quality at reasonable rate.|1
Tremendous sale going right now! Love it there cause they try to keep things organized and clean all the time! They do such a great job!!!|1
I love it! Have different areas depending of the style that are you looking|1
Better store than other H&M.|1
Always good experience.Staff is friendly and helpful.Store is clean and organized.Only draw back is every time I shop Small sizes in Easy Iron shirts and Super skinny pants and Chinos is lacking.|1
McKayla at the Newbury St store was so helpful and very friendly and welcoming helping us checkout. We definitely be back to this store!|1
H&M, it’s awesome. Always down to buy inexpensive clothes that are pretty stylish.  Good experience at this location. Would recommend. Stay classy.|1

Large selection of babies, infants, toddlers clothing|1

I would not shop here. The commercial has the MOST Horrific looking outfits and the black haired women is so hard to look at...for goodness sakes please  do something with those  eyebrows. Just poor fashion and taste all around.|0
I came to H&M Lakeland and it was the worst experience. The fitting rooms close 40 minutes before the clothing store closes. The customer service was terrible. And the teens that work there don’t have any customer service skills and have a terrible attitude. I came with my mom from out of the country and It was a Horrendous experience.|0
Basically, the mall is 2 steps away from closing. Nothing in it is worth anything. And unless you want Chinese food, there's not much to choose from to eat. There is now 5 Chinese fast food places in the food court, and that's about it. Go to Brandon, Tampa or Orlando. This place sucks.|0
This is my experience after trying to get in contact with the mall manager over several phone calls, none of which were answered or returned. I have sat in the mall management office for 10 minutes now with no offers for assistance. One of the employees looked at me through his door, then looked down and dramatically exhaled, clearly showing contempt for their customers. He closed the door, and I could hear what sounded like it couldn't be anything but a belt being fumbled with, and then a zipper. Some unnamed representative finally came up to speak with me, and she told me that performing permits aren't distributed, despite a security officer having told me they can be. I am not just fighting for myself, I want to get a shade put up over the bus benches so other people and I won't have to suffer, baking in the insane heat that Florida is famous for.|0
I'm a fan of the FYE store and finally went around the entire mall recently with my service dog and my mum. The Dillard's is like something out of an early CSI (original) episode, kinda creepy, mysterious stains, and smells like dead something. The staff I encountered throughout the mall were really friendly and had great service dog etiquette. I was shocked to learn that they pretty much just let any dog inside because the owners didn't educate them about service dog laws (did a quick run down with a security guard and Claire's employee, misbehaving dogs, SD or not, can be asked to leave). After we grabbed a quick lunch at the food court, I was disgusted to spot my service dog investigating a bunch of bugs crawling across the floor. After that, we promptly left. I doubt we'll return. The staff we met were nice, polite, and helpful, but bugs around food is not okay.|0
I purchased a bathing suit in Miami and tried to return it since I didn't use it but no one informed me of he no bottom return until I went to return it in Lakeland.  I just want to know why the hell would you return the top not the bottom that's a stupid policy.  People try on them bathing suits in the store but you all won't return them.  I will not purchase from here anymore due to that stupid policy and because when I purchased the bathing suit the policy should have been told to me and I wouldn't have purchased it I would have went elsewhere.  Never again.  Make sure this policy is told to your customers because I wouldn't have know until I purchased the bathing suit since the policy isn't posted up in the store but only on the back of the receipt.|0
(2019)  The locator thingy is in the wrong spot. Size wise it would be ideal for H & M to take over the Sears spot since Sears is finally closed but otherwise I'm leaving this a 4 star until it's moved to the exact location on this map. After that, I'll take my comment & rating down.  (NOTE: My rating doesn't reflect the store & employees so please check them out.) ________________________________________ (2020)  .... OK. I'm guessing the store owner must not had posted the location of the H&M cursor because my comment is a year old and it's still located on the wrong side of the map. Nothing has came to where the cursor is currently at and H&M is located near J.C.Penney.|0
Extremely rude and loud employees, below average clothes that fit a minimal amount of people, and cheap and rough fabrics. the only good thing is the jeans but i’d say to order the online because the experience in stores are just awful|0
I tried the store because it said it had  plus sizes now but they're plus sizes are nowhere near plus sizes. It's for the younger possibly chunkier junior plus not women|0
To start this off I would like to say I am a black man raising a beautiful young black boy. Growing up i was called monkey not because I was active but because the racial undertone of what it represent. I can give a short history lesson on how African Americans had to prove that we were actual humans and we were perceived to be equivalents to monkeys. They even put children in a zoo in cages throwing bananas at them,spitting, and throwing rocks at them while spitting racial slurs. For a company that big who has people  to research things like this should of caught this early because honestly this information and correlation isn't hard to find. So for the lack of care and respect for a specific racial demographic. This place will never get a penny from me. Not a good company for ne...|0
The store was a mess, clothes on top of racks, accessories on the ground. Waited for 15 minutes in the checkout line at such a small location. I could not believe how disorganized and sloppy this store is.|0
Nothing that would attract tourist or even locals to this mall.  Very boring.  If you are retired nice nap too sit and soak up some free air conditioning.|0
This place has gotten worse and worse over the years. The clientele does not support any sort of high end shopping and any nice stores don't last more than a year lately.|0
I used to love this location but the cashier treated me so rudely. Tell your customers that what they are buying is non refundable before you sell it to them. The cashier got so snippy with me|0
Its a mall. No security ever seen allowing punks to throw fireworks at sleeping infants. Oddly specific? You better believe it.|0
If you go there during the day or Monday through Thursday its a nice place...forget the weekend's security does not control The Adolescents.|0
Let's get some stores in there that everybody wants to go to not the handful of rednecks that still live in this town we don't need a camouflage store in the Lakeland Mall, want this mall to be flourishing and booming put stores that people go to, need a hint go  to the Brandon Mall that's where I drive.|0
Y’all better teach a certain black security guard how to talk to another man’s woman before he loses some teeth.|0
The mall is not the same anymore.  All they have is high price stores in there. All the good stores left|0
This mall is so junky, plus it has no good variety of stores to shop at. You're better off going to Tampa or Orlando mall|0
They Never have my size so I'm going to stop going to this hm location. I might stop going period if all stores are alike|0
expect your car to get broken in, expect annoying ass teenagers, expect nasty people here. The stores suck, and they are dirty. don't bother.|0
Mall is closing many of it's shops.  Quality of the products available is very low end.|0
Place is rundown and outdated with about 50% of all the stores closed down. Terrible mall.|0
Very little inventory for men and the fitting rooms were closed|0
Went to the carnival $30 for a wristband and my Granddaughter could only go on 4 rides.|0
A place where you can wait in line and no one be at the register for more then 15 min. That will be the last time i come here|0
Could not get any help when we were at Sears. Not shopping there anymore.  They have NOTHING|0
its depressing to describe in one word. Ugliest mall ever.|0
lots of stores closing. only the food court is ok|0
Google  Maps is failing again.  I wasn't even there.    This is happening a lot lately.|0
Worst mall ever it is so hard to find stores in that mall.|0
Horrible mall, dirty and the customers there are not nice|0
This place has gone waaayyy downhill and they need to knock it down and start over.|0
If you dint buy something as soon as you see it, youll lose it.|0
Racks were so full couldn't even look at the clothes.|0
Not impressed with variety for plus size women|0
Smells like an old attic. Crappy flea market stores.|0
Shabby, only a few good stores left.|0
Was better as Burdines.  Represented florida style better|0
Just stopped for a quick look.|0
Nothing there for young folks really dead environment|0
grossest mall I've been to.|0
This USED to be a mall. Thanks, Amazon!|0

Siempre vacío. No me gusta para nadaaaa  (Translated by Google) Always empty. I don't like it at all|0
A lot of empty spaces. Poorly and sparsely placed directories. Nothing for kids to do. Stores are cool, but even they offer less selection than they use to.  Great please for senior walkers, very few customers in the way.  It's a shame. This place used to be a really cool place to shop.  Owners are doing another to prevent it's demise.|0
Great location but... Another sad example of the failing of retail stores. Macy's was shut down. Burlington is sloppy & smells unclean. Much of the outside of the mall has a look of abandonment. If I could, I'd inject some life into this area with a couple beautiful dine in restaurants, some high end retail and a facelift to beautify the outside.|0
Went to take my daughter homecoming dress shopping.  There were slim pickings for stores.  Everything in the mall is marked down for store closing.  You might be able to find a good deal.|0
It's a good mall but in most of their stores tney need to keep it more clean and orginized, I know it's  not their fault that some costumers leave a mess but it still looks bad to not tidy up the place and lately  in most of their stores there is no cashier  or employee in sight to help out.|0
There is not a good selection of stores in my opinion. There are also lots of empty spaces. I will stop in at times to visit one or two stores,  but gone are the says if spending a morning or a day shopping at this mall. The couple of stores that I visit are on one end of the mall. I can park on that end, visit the two stores, then leave. Some of the other stores that I usednto visit have moved across the street.|0
It's a bummer because this mall does have so much potential with it's location right off 98, but this just feels like a dying mall.  There is an entire wing of the mall that is vacant, and then some of the stores I just can't imagine anyone actually visiting.  I would much rather go to Lakeside or travel to one of the outlets than visit this mall near my home.|0
This mall has gone downhill over the years. It has the big chain stores that you'd expect, however all the good shops in between the big stores have abandoned and seems like a flea market with a JC Pennys and Macy's..etc.|0
Update the closing information, it closes at 8 pm.|0
Great stores, but maintenance is crappy. Only 1 soap dispenser works in ladies room, half the sinks do not have water, only 1 working hand dryer out of 3.|0
When you see how empty it is getting..... Take Note Don't scurry your customers away just so you can close on time.  How about actually staying open another hour or two so customers can finish shopping. Not everyone has banker hours and I am in line with plenty of other customers as we are being driven out of the  businesses.  I'm done spending my money where someone doesn't want my business.|0
Little to no stores, half the mall was empty, the food court was the best part. the theater is a nice touch as well, saving grace for a fading mall|0
The mall is dying. Could be a sign of the times, or mismanagement, but with the major end stores closing, the mall should be an incubator for more local businesses and updated chains.|0
I don't care for this mall at all they need new stores how many shoe stores do you need. it's like the mattress firm one every 100 feet|0
NOT ENOUGH OPTIONS 4 PLUS SIZES. SHOES WAAAAAYYYYY OUT OF RANGE!! BURLINGTON NEEDS BETTER PRIZES FOR SHOES, REALLY!!|0
A lot of empty spaces that used to be shops. Bored store employees standing around because business is so bad. This place has gone downhill fast.|0
I've visited this store multiple times since it opened and have yet to find anything my size. I'm not plus size but I'm not a size 2. Also, this store is European so add about 2 sizes to your normal size.|0
I used to love to shop here until they made most of the food Asian food and got rid of so many good stores!|0
It's unfortunate, but this mall is fading out.  Used to be a great shopping experience. Not so now.|0
Went on a Sunday looking for the Hallmark store. Parking lot was mobbed, frustrated drivers going every which way looking for parking spaces. A real circus, so we left.|0
They need to fix the A/C in Dillard's. It was musty and damp not as bad in the Inside walking area but inside the stores was bad|0
Great place to walk around and window shop. Alot of neat little stores.|0
Why isn't someone cleaning the entrances...trash, cigarette buds, overflowing garbage...and the plants can someone attend to them...and how can a person try to clean a table if you are not looking at it...made it worst...sad...|0
I never really liked the area, and there is a poor selection of stores to shop at. Also, the clientele do not support any type of high end shopping or stores.|0
The Malls has gotten so run down and dirty on the outside it make me not want to shop there. Hardly cars there ever and if there is its the employees.|0
Macy's recently closed down. The mall lighting is very dim. I only go there for Crazy 8 and the shoe stores.|0
Clothes are basic looking but overpriced. Look somewhere else that doesnt have boring clothes.|0
it was fun it just needs nicer security with a smile they look kinda mean lol|0
Dead. Dining is a joke. Stores are a joke. Constant closures and moving of stores. Meh, I suppose the 80s and 90s had to die sometime.|0
I travel for work a lot, and this is one of the worst malls I've been to. The layout is strange, not very clean.|0
Only have clothes that will fit a skinny teenager...anyone over size 36 waist is screwed|0
This store is too crowded and discombobulated to find anything, it makes my OCD go into overdrive.|0
Loud music. No plus size or business wear. Nice staff.|0
Feels kind of dirty and unkept, amount of store options are not great.|0
Went to JcPenney. They employees were a little rude. Ended up putting stuff back up and walking out.|0
This mall is on life support. No real great stores.|0
Very crowded but you find cute stuff here|0
One dead mall.  Macy's just closed there and it doesn't look like the rest is far behind|0
Outside not well kept / clean Inside dirty Water marks on ceiling Too many closed store fronts|0
Those mall is dying.  Macys closed down here.|0
Not a big selection of name brand stores.|0
One of the worst malls I've ever been too|0
Not much going on in this mall. It needs an upgrade.|0
Compared to all the malls in the bay area, this one is down there on the bottom of the list.|0
Store brand names keep closing and being replaced with small stand up shops.|0
Looks like it is closing. Very few stores anymore.|0
When are the owners gonna just take the tax break and shut this poor place down?|0
Nice facility but very empty.|0
Clothes are not in plus size and they are a little expensive|0
Too small, hardly any room to walk|0
Came here for Christmas shopping, it's so dead and no shops for guys|0
Not very clean.  Shady people walking around.|0
Meh. Not a huge selection. Rather go to Orlando.|0
Pretty much dead. not much of a mall|0
Very old style. Needs remodeling bad!|0
Its old lots of shops leaving the mall|0
it sure has changed over the years|0
Small mall but okay|0
Too many stores leaving.|0
The worse customer service ever|0

Cada dos semanas voy al mall y lo q no me agrada es que los alrededores estan sucios basura donde quiera en la entrada del mall  necesitan tener una mejor apariencia  tienen buenas tiendas y por dentro del mall se ve muy bien al igual la comida solo es ese detalle de limpieza  (Translated by Google) Every two weeks I go to the mall and what I don't like is that the surroundings are dirty garbage everywhere at the entrance of the mall they need to have a better appearance they have good stores and inside the mall it looks very good as well as the food is just that cleaning detail|0
Like most malls, Lakeland Square is suffering from the lack of interest in brick and mortar shopping.  Macy's is of about middling quality.|1
I was looking for skirts and was disappointed they had almost nothing. The skirts they did have were like a wool material, hello this is Florida too hot to wear that. Also the quality of shoes was horrible and way overpriced.|1
So many stores that were high quality have closed in this mall. Macy's is on its way out, and there are cheap shops like Nova that sell Chinese knock-off goods that might last a whole week. Save your money and go to a better mall. This one is good for Dillard's, and that's about it. Oh, and the food court does have some decent food.|1
I used to love coming here when I was a teen but now it seems so weird and empty. There are more kiosks now than there were in past years but the larger stores have left. There are several empty stores and the mall isn't very busy. I believe they have made a lot of improvements in attempt to increase visitors, but I'm not sure it's enough.|1
The lighting is too much, you feel like you are frying in there! They have good clothes offers but the last time I went I had to rush because I think the air conditioner wasn’t working|1
This mall used to be full all the time but now its more or less a ghost town. While I did easily find what I was looking for here at Victoria's Secret there isn't much else left. I guess all the malls in America have more or less gone the way of the dodo.|1
The mall feels very repetitive. Almost every store is similar to the other one next to it and the Theater is overpriced and has no arcade. The overall experience is pleasing if you're looking to just roam the mall but there wont be much to find.|1
For a while, this mall felt a bit run down. Recently, they have been trying to revitalize and refurbish things. There are still too many places to buy cell phone accessories, but it's getting better.|1
This mall is okay, I guess. Every time I go I try to get in and get out as soon as possible. The last time I went I saw a guy get tasered like 3 feet away from me. If you can go to any other mall I would recommend that you do, but if this is the only place close to you its not too bad they can definitely improve.|1
Wow this mall has really gone down hill. There are so many closed stores. So I go to find Spencer's Gifts they had moved closer to the food court because the end of the mall they were at is now a ghost town. This is just a sign of the times it won't be long until they bulldoze this place to put in homes|1
Large indoor mall. Excellent for walking exercise. Has Sear's, Penny's, Burlington, and Dillard's as anchor stores. Has multiscreen movie theater but no inside mall entrance.Has decent food court but no sit down restaurant in the mall. Several restaurants outside on the road surrounding the mall. Mall is thirty years old but is in good condition.|1
There is a nice selection of anchor stores, but the smaller stores change way too often. The food court has a good enough selection.  I just wish the map on Google was better and kept up to date.|1
Nice Small Mall, my little one wanted to go on the trampolines, the guy working there obviously hated his job, didn’t speak to the kids or adults just mumbled and pointed, then spent his whole time on his phone while the children were jumping. Food court was clean and a nice choice of food.|1
It's fine but they have security that likes to get slick with. You. For example me and my brother road our skateboard there. They are. Allowed. Security trys to take it because she doesn't like skateboards.|1
This mall used to be a very big deal when I was younger but it seems to be slowly dying. It's not as nice as it used to be, alot of stores are going out of business leaving empty spaces, not as clean. But it is a mall and still has decent stores available.|1
Most of the good anchor stores have pulled out of this mall with JC Penny one of the few remaining. They built a nice theater a while back but the south side of the city is where the money is so LSM is just not the place to shop any more.|1
The clientele here are fuggin garbage. There are some decent stores and a really nice theater. I recommend avoiding most stores if you can though. Unless you have a license to carry. Then you're good|1
"Over the years this mall has had a hard time keeping stores open here. We go when its a quick spur of the moment trip but when we're seeking an actual mall we unfortunately have to go elsewhere. Most of the more popular stores have moved around and taken up more of the spaces to make it seem ""fuller"" than it actually is. The food court options are pretty bleak. You have pizza, chinese, chik fila (if its not sunday) or more chinese."|1
Staff was great. I loved miss ann shes amazing. Freindly house keeper. Did everything i asked for everyday without hesitation. My husband is a truck driver and miss sara the manager allowed me to stay as lomg as i need until his trianer got there. Pet freindly hotle but gotta tell u. Rooms didnt smell like pets. We didnt hear and pets the whole 2weeks we were there. Prices are good. And the restaurant s are just a walk away. And 5 min from harrys new orleans style resturante. Omg you habe to try it. Anyhow hotle is between tampa and orlando. Safe neighborhood and respectful ppl in the area.|1
Needs more stores. Dead mall at one end. But food court actually had good food. Mall was clean but I personally would like more decorations during the holidays. Kinda blah.|1
Not a huge variety of stores and there are better malls if you drive a little farther (Orlando). Food court is great but lacks many great stores. Not crowded so if you are looking for a mall with few stores and a small crowd, this is for you.|1
Went in through Burlington coat factory.  Didn't like that there are no handicap doors. Overall mall is quiet and slow not too many options to shop.|1
The mall is getting more stores again and nicer than it was for a while! Hopefully it will keep going in the right direction! Love all the food options.|1
Pros: Good variety of stores, family friendly, the movie theater is super nice and cheap Cons: People smoking right outside the entrance or vaping inside, needs healthier options in the food court|1
Everything is overpriced in mostly every store but I like to look around anyway I like the game attic store which has old school Nintendo video games and original Xbox video games I'm mad that they got rid of the pet store because i would always go in there everytime.I really wish it was a two story mall that has escalators so it could have a lot more stores that would be cool|1
A nice place for an air conditioned stroll around convenient shops and a tasty collection of fast food eateries in the food court. Best bourbon chicken in town at the Perry’s BBQ.|1
Decent mall but much like all others it's slowly dying. Could definitely be cleaner, but you can't expect much from a place on the decline. They still have a decent collection of stores though.|1
A decent mall, but it is diminishing in the number of stores. The economy of the 1980's and 1990's has long since left Lakeland Square Mall in reminiscence of a time before the Internet. I will miss this place when it is gone.|1
Godd mall over all,  they need to take care of the entrance. You can have the best mall in side but if the building don't looks atractive from out side people don't gonna go to often.|1
The mall has gone downhill since the departure of several anchor stores. Penny's and Dillards are still there and remain the last of the big box clothing retailers in Lakeland. Sad knowing that Sears is on their way out along with Toys RUs.|1
The mall has improved a lot it is still quiet during the week (which i love) and more stores have opened, increasing the variety|1
This mall is nice but could use some remodeling inside along with an updated food court. but over all not bad|1
The restrooms needed serious help. There where a lot of variety of stores to choose from and friendly store workers. The parking needed work. They needed more security outside.|1
"Once the main mall in the area, it is now run down and lacking many major ""mall stores"". They are trying to resurrect, and are attracting some new stores so hopefully it will return to its former glory."|1
Never too crowded just wish there was more stores and things to do there..expand up make it worth doing a whole day of shopping.|1
Mostly i just visited the game shop there, they even have 1 copy of my favorite Saturn game! Hint: its $460😁 Great game shop. …|1
For shopping its great, just dont go try to get your nails and eyebrows done as a walk in they will give you a run around. Not worth it go elsewhere|1
Small mall with a single story of stores, but covers the major expectations of a mall. Bath & Bodyworks, Dillards, FYE, Cinderella Bridal, The Ink Spot (Tattoo shop), Spencer's, Comics and Hobbies, and more.|1
Wish there was more varieties of stores and eateries inside this mall. But it serves the purpose if you want a quick shopping trip.|1
Not like it use to be. To many shoe  and jewelry stores. No restaurant anymore, only the food court. Prefer Lakeside Village over the mall.|1
This mall used to be my favorite place to shop. It's definitely seen better days but it's still a good place to do some shopping|1
Limited number of high quality stores. Anchor stores are either out of business, replaced by discount stores, or don't carry the full selection they do in other locations.|1
Did not find anything that was my style can't say the same for others try it for yourself|1
Great mall lots of stores.  just wish they stopped closing so many. I seriously recommend perry's in the food court.|1
The mall still need more selective stores to shop from.  Macy's will soon be done, can't wait to see what store will replace them.|1
This mall has a decent number of popular stores and is clean. It seemed a bit dark inside. The lighting could use a boost.|1
Okay for a quick trip to JCP.  Mall is in need of major renovation.  Doesn't appear safe, especially at night.|1
Organized and clean. They don't carry plus size. Pretty things for young people. A little $$|1
It's an OK mall to go and get something quick but it could use more stores and expand to a second floor.|1
Has a lot of good stores and deals. But there is also a lot of theft and I don't care for the food court options|1
Some stores make the mall look run down.. Like it might be closing. I doesn't help that Macy's is now relocating.|1
Good to see in the day and time of online shopping you still have a great option of shopping in person.|1
It's a ok mall could be better a lot of stories have closed with more to come|1
The posted mall hours for sundays says 11am till 9 although the stores dont open until 12pm i wish that info was more clear|1
It's ok, standard Mall, has been improved a lot recently with a H&M coming soon.|1
It's a great place, just minimal stores and not much there|1
Mall is clean, but activity is very low. I was hoping to find better sales at anchor stores.|1
Older mall. Still decent. A place to go if you just want to kill time.|1
This is a great little mall, as far as malls can go.  Not a very crowded mall.`|1
I rated this a 3 star because it is basically plain and boring. I don't like much except Chick fil A.|1
Well it's really the only mall in Lakeland, decent selection of stores, but it's a work in progress.|1
A decent shopping place for nice fashion and eats. Has a great food court|1
I don't like the selection, but the employees are great. The sizes aren't inclusive, but what can I expect?|1
The mall itself is a little outdated with the courtyard has new stores a few that are updating the mall could be better in my opinion|1
I went to Burlington to buy my husband something for Father's Day and their big and tall shirt selection in not good.|1
Nice place to shop. I think we were the only people there|1
It's the only mall close and has Burlington coat factory which is a great store|1
Decent mall. Only vape shop in area open past 7pm is Vape Room in the mall|1
Nice variety of local and national stores with great food court.|1
Not a bad mall but few big and tall options|1
It's closing down a lot of stored, but it's still s good place to hang out at|1
I think this mall is on it's way out.  Stores are closing quickly.|1
I figured to come by here after years but there is barely any stores here. Kind of sad. Guess I got to stick with Florida Mall for now on.|1
Ok store if u like thier style and good prices|1
The quality of the stores is going down.  More no name stores and starting to look trashy.|1
Quality of this mall is sub par but it is a good place to kill time and randomly find stuff to buy|1
Not one of the nicer malls in central Florida.  It's pretty basic and semi-clean.|1
Very disorganized and clustered. Clothes on the floor. Store looks dirty.|1
Good place to shop but hardly any stores|1
It needs to have more updated stores. It's much to big to have such crappy stores|1
Pause emptying out there Charlie nothing there anymore I think they need to come up with a new and improve Lakeland Square|1
Macy's is gone, so it's not as great. The food court isn't my fave either.|1
This mall is pretty old and kind of rundown. Mostly just your basic mall stores in it.|1
Getting pretty run down. The great decline of the mall continues.|1
This mall just ain't the same as it used to be since so many stores have closed|1
Small and not much to look at but if you need to pick up something quick and get out is ok.|1
Nice mall, but why close at 21:00 on a Friday and Saturday?|1
Even though they are supposed to be cheap they have pretty high prices|1
Nice design but doesn't compare to Brandon or Citrus park.|1
Don't like any mall really but it's ok.|1
Mall is too small and the stores aren't that great but there is a movie theater.|1
They're plenty of stores in which to shop..Good bargains at Burlington|1
Everything is poor man prices and the shoes is durable.|1
This mall is very out dated. But has a H&M store which is a must go to.|1
Nice mall just need more stores|1
Basic mall, Macy's was going out of business...didn't find many deals at all|1
Definitely not the mall for a shopaholic, but it's worth a visit.|1
I've noticed that more stores are closed now, not sure what that means for the mall.|1
Dirty. I only go if I have to.... Or if I want Perry's BBQ LOL.|1
"Store selection is mediocre at best.  It's everything you'd expect from ""just a mall"""|1
It's okay but mall's are dinosaurs they'll be extinct doon5|1
This mall is falling apart.|1
Old mall. seems like its on the way to becoming a run down strip mall. Alot of the bigger department store have left.|1
It has great stores a little dated|1
Not to much business anymore lot's of stores closed|1
Very quite slow run down needs more stores and needs to be remodeled|1
Nice mall, But is going down hill a bit.|1
Large amount of store vacancies. Not any high end stores or large brand stores at this mall.|1
Nice clean mall that offers little.|1
It's ok but not much food selection|1
Not a lot of stores other then the normal mall stores. Most have closed!|1
Could use some more nice shops|1
Wonderful selection but the place was dead.|1
Slow decline in customers. A familiar site in malls all over the USA...|1
I still don't know what H&M stands for after going inside.|1
Don't like crowds but found what I went for  ..good deal|1
Gone down hill over the years.. parking completely sucks!|1
Most of the meat here is tough like leather.|1
It's not the Lakeland Mall I remember but it's still okay.|1
I wish there was more selection for man|1
Not quite what it used to be you got to check out the movies though|1
Lots of empty stores. Seems to be slowly turning into a flea market.|1
Mall is just OK. Not top notch. Needs updated!|1
Most stores are closed or don't care for your business|1
Great shopping for all year around|1
If you want to take a trip back to the 1980’s, this is the place to do it!|1
Nice place to get exercise on hot days|1
As malls are closing.  Not enough stories|1
Went to the movies... Saved some moved for going early.|1

Dying mall|1
(Translated by Google) In some stores the staff could be friendlier dillards. And don't always ask if it's already finished although you still want to look. It's as if they don't want to sell. Therefore only 3 stars. The mall all in all 5 stars  (Original) In manchen Geschäfte könnten die Angestellten freundlicher sein dillards.  Und nicht immer fragen ob mach schon fertig ist obwohl man noch schauen möchte . Das kommt einem vor als wollen die nicht verkaufen . Deshalb nur 3 Sterne. Die Mall alles in allem 5 sterne|1
Ok si buscas una tienda donde encuentres ropa buena y económica, está no es la tienda. Pero si hay variedad de ropa. No precisamente bonita. Sólo ropa! No es una tienda a la cual iría específicamente al centro comercial  (Translated by Google) Ok if you are looking for a store where you can find good and cheap clothes, this is not the store. But if there is a variety of clothes. Not exactly pretty. Only clothes! Not a store I would specifically go to in the mall|1
HE ESTADO AHÍ  MUY POCAS VECES, PERO NO ME GUSTA MUCHO.  (Translated by Google) I'VE BEEN THERE VERY FEW TIMES, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT.|1
Ropa. Nada del otro mundo  (Translated by Google) Clothes. Nothing special|1
Normal mall.|1
Late version of the traditional mall with strong anchor stores. Modern design with short corridors which keep the tradition mall noises down. Adequate parking and access. Wanted a cup of coffee, alas it was not to be, all food related seemed to be only in a small out of the way food court. Other malls I enjoy have various food and beverage vendor dispersed amount the corridors. Nice mall but not worth going out of your way for.|1
I like the renovations and new stores added to keep the mall relevant and a desired hangout location.|1
Good clothing and nice sales people clean store prices are are high could have been a little more organized|1
Overall it's a good experience, with most spaces filled. Dillards must not have long for this world given how run-down it has been allowed to get. Lots of choices in the food court, helping make this mall still a decent place to visit.|1
It's still a nice mall despite the some stores that shut down here. They still got most chain retailers still open at the mall. They could consider a remodel in some areas like around the food court looked the same for years not much changes here. The least busiest part of the mall is where the former macy's was and between Dillard's and Sear's section seem to have more empty storefronts. Hopefully they'll be able to maintain it in the future if not it will end up like most malls around the country that are declining.|1
Probably the last mall Polk County will see if Eagle Ridge ever finally shuts down. The mall is kept up pretty well and seems to be doing pretty well in terms of success. Would probably give five stars if it was able to fill all of the storefronts with better stores.|1
I'm not sure what is going on with this review but H&M is not Burlington, which are the pictures associated...besides that, H&M is typical. This is store is huge and clean. I wish they would carry plus size.|1
I would give it a 5 stars if there were to be a forever 21, Rue 21, and Justice, maybe a Gucci but it’s ok! And it’ll be better if the mall had better restaurants, like Subway (R.I.P) or cicis pizza, and a bigger and better place plays for the little ones will be cool too!  Love, local shopper 😌|1
Nice mall, not as busy as the Florida Mall in Orlando. Good selection of stores but looks to be in a build up of store fronts. Lots of jewelry kiosk with plated gold stuff and not a good selection of watches. Food court was nice. Wife went for pizza, me too but added a very expensive chicken grilled cheese sandwich, from some grilled cheese place. Really didn't go to shop, we wanted to get exercise and steps on or Fitbit.|1
I was shopping here while visiting family. Much busier than the local mall back home. Lots of shops. I could come here with the whole family and there would be something for everyone. Snagged some great deals at Burlington's.|1
I love the mall I just wish there was an arcade cause my friends and I always go there to hang out and we usually always do the same thing (shop and talk), but I think it would be cool if there was an arcade.|1
A very quaint little shop to browse throughout. An over anxious crowd abound however, makes for shopping quite unsettling. Perhaps it was a little too close to end of quota sessions?|1
It is a centralized  easy park,place to go.Good area typical movie house.Good popcorn and all the things  you do in-house  rather than  stream.Fun chance to see  movie when  it comes out and everyone is  talking about  it.Great family  place.|1
I gave this mall four stars mostly because American malls are dying out and this one is still hanging in there. It is also one of those malls you DONT get trapped in bc it's too big or in the middle of no where. This one has easy access in and out and is surrounded by more stand alone shopping and restaurants and near a major highway.|1
I really like this mall because it is quiet and have a good amount to offer. I wish they had more popular stores to choose from. Their food court is decent.|1
Best place to find authentic Jamaican food.(JERK CHICKEN EXPRESS) Offers big plates enough to feed two(if you get your plate made by the owner or lexi) and meals start off at 6.99 They have: Ox tail Brown stew chicken Goat and chicken  curry Jerk chicken And much more!|1
If you don't like crowds this is your place to shop especially during the week. Pretty quiet for a mall! Good stores.|1
Good selection and variety at food court. Typical mall setup and stores. Would like to see some type of attraction or promotion to bring in foot traffic.|1
Ac was broken so wasnt able to shop but just for a few moments. They had sooo much much stuff I'm definitely going back. They had everything!!!!!!!|1
It's nice to walk a round the mall, since there is always a new store either opening or closing. But it's got a lot of variety in this mall, from video games to cloths. To major stores|1
Love this mall. Wish a few stores weren't so crazy priced. But other than that, this mall has a great selection.|1
A somewhat small mall that has a good amount of shops, food, and other things to do. I haven't been there on the weekend, but during the week it's one of the least busy malls I've seen.|1
Movie theater was nice clean and some fresh popcorn for the morning show.. that was a nice feature. Typically its leftover popcorn from the night before.|1
It's always fairly peaceful and laid back during the day and more populated towards the afternoon. Can be crowded but overall not a bad place.|1
I like the verity in shops here. There is always a bunch of people of course, no different from most malls. Has one story but in the perfect location.|1
Great location, many different stores to choose from & it has a nice clean food court with lots of places to sit & eat|1
The mall is slowly getting better and adding better stores. It's very nice and always clean. Has all the usual stores.|1
The Cinemark theater is Awesome. Very different movie theater experience with the reclining leather chairs and reserved seating. Very nice movie watching experience.|1
The lakeshore mall is a fun place to go.  Watch a movie, play in the arcade, get overpriced mall food, hope your favorite stores haven't shut down yet because the man is slowly dying.|1
It is a nice mall. Good big name anchor stores. Clean. Always slow and not a lot of foot traffic inside.|1
Pretty nice mall, close to it all, easy access, great prices, wide variety, spacious and great food court options.|1
it has really nice stores and great deals. the workers there are also very polite and interact alot with the customers.|1
This is Lakelands oldest mall. It continues to update it's stores which are all very cool. It has a nice selection in its food court.|1
Nice mall but it's small compared to others I've been in.  Pretty good food court.|1
It has great food and good stores but some things are a little too pricey|1
Reasonably good selection of stores-- not as crowded as some of the glitzy malls. Good selection of food available.|1
It's a nice mall, small enough to be comfortable, but with a selection of enough cool clothes to find what you're looking for.|1
Fun usually have good or great time alot to do ,but i also do think security show act a bit nicer|1
Not bad but the stores are limited. We usually go to Westfield in Brandon but this mall is good for a quick trip.|1
Has improved quite a bit.  Turned into a pretty decent mall.  Lots of nice stores now.|1
It's nice got a good selection of stores.  It has a good food court.|1
I don't go there much, but it is a nice shopping mall.|1
Very nice mall. Shops for everyone. Not an over priced mall like some.|1
Good enough place, very small for a mall, somewhat limited food options but the Chinese food is good.|1
Great if you like the mall shopping scene has everything you need.|1
It is a nice mall. The anchor stores are good, the food court is nice, and the building is well maintained.|1
One of the best malls still alive. Food court is awesome and store variety is wonderful.|1
It's not as crowded a other malls. Wish they had more stores.|1
Great mall fun to hang with friends till you've seen every store|1
New stores have made for a better shopping experience.  Need to reopen the sit down restaurant.|1
Good places to shop, with good food. Plus they are great for Black Friday shopping|1
Large mall, clean good food court. But seriously needs better anchor stores. It was very crowded.|1
Has always been a good place. Needs some stores in though|1
Good place to shop around. Always felt safe in this Mall...|1
Nice place to shop. Great food court. JC Penney store is great.|1
Went to Chick-fil-A they're always good they always get it right the chicken sandwiches are great|1
Inventory was way down from the holidays, but i was able to get the last drill i needed!!|1
Nice mall.  Good stores. I like it. R stars room for improvement.|1
A little limited but a good place to kill some time whip you wait for the movie.|1
Outside looked like no one was there but once inside it was filled with people. Also great selection of stores.|1
Receptionist is unprofessional but the artist's are good and makes you feel very comfortable|1
It's getting better. They are adding better stores to shop at instead of the same type of spread throughout.|1
Good mall but I wish there was more of a variety of stores.|1
It's a good place to walk around and shop for the things you need|1
Love your mall I really miss JC and Sears hope that you have good plans for it|1
Clean nice assortment of stores and a good clean place for small kids to play|1
Did not think Mall would be that large.  Great selections, will be going back often.|1
Love the store.. But it's no one on the dressing room for help|1
Good selection in food court. Love that they have a Burlington here.|1
Good hang out area a lot of stores and food just toooo much money|1
Starting to get renovated. It has become a decent place to shop again|1
Nice mall.. good selection of stores and food.|1
Always something to buy or a tasty meal to be had at our local mall|1
I like going here. Good variety of stores and clean|1
Had a good shopping experience everyone was very friendly and professional..|1
Pretty nice mall, good selection at the food court.|1
Has a pretty good food court and a sears that hasn't closed down yet.|1
