Lifts poorly located in the far corner. Kids dept was far at the top level which should be located more conveniently. Staff at the till in ladieswear were unfriendly and unhelpful. The 'SYSTEM' was giving a higher price than the label and the assistant said the label was wrong - well you were wrong as The Manager came to resolve! Basic Customer Service training needed. I didn't feel I was a valued customer. Then the Assistant couldn't help to get another item from the upper level, 'I can't leave the till blah blah blah' - think outside of the box! I had 3 children and your store layout is ridiculous. Your prices were not correct and items for the 3 for 2 promotion were wrongly placed which inconvenienced me and so I left them. 3 white tshirts for PE £2.99 and the next size up £9.99 which didnt make sense. Very very dissapointed as all sizes upto 14+ are £2.99 online but the 3 for 2 and promo is not online! Waste of time! Staff should handle the situation better! I just want good service!|0
I experienced racism! It's so bad.. The cashier asked to use self check service but didn't help me remove the security tag! When I came back home I found it still locked on my clothes.|0
Very Unprofessional staff.  Manager kitty was such a rude person. Her behaviour was very unprofessional. We brought something from the shop but forgot to take the tags off. Apparently had to come back for this. Member of staff checked everything and took it off. All of sudden another member of staff stopped us by the door and took the shopping away. Asked to go to till in a very rude way regardless listening to our statement. Even when we went to till she wasn’t interested to listen straight way called manager (kitty) and there started interesting part. She came up to us with very loud voice like we stole million pound. We been requesting again and again to go and talk to her staff who sorted things for us. She was almost screaming with us front of all other customers and everyone was looking at us. Tbh I felt so down. Anyway at the end she apologised to us and admitted her mistake. If management watching this review then,All I want from H&M is to train those unprofessional, overexcited and uncivilised staff like KITTY.|0
Unprofessional staff, not all of them but the guy at ladies fitting room is very arrogant and he thinks the customers are his workers. Very disrespectful. This happened on 5th nov at 18:30.|0
I bought 3 items at this store at around 8:30pm on 15 Aug but the staff just packed 2 items into the bag. I came back to ask for camera check but they promised to check in the next day then contact me via my phone number even it was the last day I stayed there. There's no response until now, I cannot come back there to check. Customer service here is poor.|0
Nice place to visit but very poor children formal clothes quality and no options.|0
They seem to have sacked 80% of their checkout staff and replaced them with ineffective self checkout terminals that most people seemingly can't operate.  I was queuing for about 20 minutes today with no movement before giving up and walking out.  It's as if they are trying to make the retail experience so unpleasant that we'd rather shop online to save ourselves the frustration 🤔|0
Terrible customer service.  We struggled to self check and there was no one to assist us. After waiting over 5 minutes for assistance we had to go to try and find someone for help.  We couldn't find anyone on the floor.  Eventually a very rude person came to the till to take our money, no hello, no apology, nothing! Worst shopping experience ever.  I would not recommend this store and I will never use the company again. Appalling service and treatment!|0
Customer service is appalling. I had questions about where the shoes were so I went up to a lady who I’m assuming was the manager (brunette, white) and she wagged her finger no at me and walked straight past me and I went up to another retail worker and she had a lot of attitude when I asked her. Disgusting|0
One of their employees literally shoved me out of the way when I was looking for something and was very rude, you guys really need to sort your staff out|0
Awful customers service. I was so chocked because the online customer service is really good. Team member at the cash desk were having personal conversation and laughing out loud between them while serving customers . A manager with long brown hair came to authorised a refund and gave attitude to the customer without even talking the her. What an awful experience to be given attitude by someone in charge in the store .Never ever again . I’ll just keep buying on line. The perfect exemple showing why online business is taking over store’s business.|0
COMPLAINT:  About the staff members in H&M Westfield Stratford (). I asked the cashier () specifically to exchange an online item with an item in store, I left both items on the desk (making it even more obvious that I wanted an exchange) However she automatically returned it, and did nothing about it. I asked the manager, she was abrupt and did not resolve the issue instead was very blunt, that they can't do anything about it. They did  not listen, instead they were very rude. I went earlier that day, and asked the manager and he said it was perfectly fine as long as the items matched the same price It was really sad, the other manager was not sympathetic at all, when I kept telling her my situation about my family relative, she abruptly repeated 'we can't do anything about it'.|0
Very rude staff! I had a very bad experience in this shop. I love H&M and I am a loyal customer but when the people who work treat you disrespectfully you are very sad after! I have never seen a shop with more ugly staff than this!|0
I was at the Stratford, Westfield branch of H&M and a few young staff members decided to follow me around the shop, they never asked if I needed help, but they were always behind me as if I was going to steal something. I would like this matter to be taken seriously, as this is very racist and prejudice. If this happens again I will take serious legal action and will raise awareness that H&M has staff members who have unconscious bias towards a specific demographic. If come back again and treated the same way I will report you to the Local Government Authority which owns the property. Please train your staff to avoid childishly following Black people, if they felt something was going to be stolen, they should have followed at a great distance so it won't ruin customer experience. I did not confront them about it as I did not want a commotion, but if I experience that treatment again I will make serious vocal complaint to media publications raising aware of the racism in H&M.|0
My mum was robbed at exactly 17:30 on the 4th of September in the Stratford branch, and the staff showed no compassion. They've done nothing to help. This store clearly isn't the safest place to be in.  Pickpocketing is one thing but robbery is another. Obviously the security aren't very useless. When my mum came home she was shivering; she had to walk because they took her phone and all her cards. She is diabetic and now she is scared to go out by herself. This is how HM treats their customers so poorly. My mum gave the full description of the culprit; it was a lady wearing the hijab but nothing has been done; instead the staff were showing attitude as if it was her fault she was robbed.|0
Great products. Second h&m in one day with rude staff on the entrance. We are all under the pressure but there 8s no need to be rude. Just before that visited other shop from different brand with very nice and friendly people around. Please work with your staff.|0
Terrible customer service today. Staff leaving till seven when massive queue. Rude staff at till whispering behind customer back. Ignored by staff member who was in front of me in downstairs till. 13:33 store GB0911 sa 132231 no 9259|0
Terrible experience. Not only H&M has terrible return policy where you can’t do straight forward  exchanges. I bought something online on Black Friday sale, size was too big so wanted to go for smaller size. Couldn’t get it for the same price as originally as you can’t exchange items. You need to return it and buy it again and of course price went back it original one. Then you go to store to return item and code that is on my label didn't work. Haven’t been offered any alternative solution or apology. I was just left with: “oh, the code doesn’t work and you need to return it online” send off. Won’t be shopping at H&M again.  Fix your return policy and poor customer service!|0
The worse H&M I have ever visited, rude staff and that is the only way that they excelled|0
"Horrible and unhelpful staff in the fitting room area ar H&M Westfield Stratford. Two memvers of the staff today at 8.42pm, talking loudly about random conversations in front of me when I came to try some trousers. Then I noticed that I needed a size more and they said they are closing and I cannot come back with the other said, it wasn't even 8.45pm yet! The only thing they said when I mention that I only needed a size more was ""sorry about that.."". It was definitely the most unprofessional service I've seen in retail and will not come back to this shop at all. There are plenty of retailers and definitely providing a better customer service!"|0
New store looks great. Staff are useless. After waiting 30 minutes in a queue, I tried to use my Westfield discount card. He denied it, called for a manager and waited 10 minutes and they didn't come. Paid full price and a young boy left the security tags on the clothes! (Kids wear department) need to make a trip back there tommorow now. Salesman is 138933. Ridiculous|0
Got forced to open a membership account even though I refused and said I didn't need it. Felt very pressured to have to waste ten minutes to open an account just so I could pay for my good.|0
This H&M hassomany choices and varietiesjuat that the guy who was handling the trial room was very impolite and rude. As me and my sister were planning to enter the trial room to try the dresses he stopped us saying we can’t go together which my sister did not understand what he was saying as other H&M stores always allows plus we had a baby. As she moved ahead he said “ do you understand what I am saying. Sorry what is this way of speaking with client asking do you understand.?  At this I was very surprised to his way of talking with the clients. Sorry to say but please train that guy how to speak with clients and to use polite terms and gentleness in speach than  trying to flaunt his style and rudeness. I lost the mood to even buy the clothes and I just tried them and hand it over to him. He needs to tone down his way of speaking. I don’t know his name but he was speaking Italian and had dreads Hair. I wanted to complain right away but was so annoyed and upset that I just walked out of the store.|0
Hello, Yesterday at 4.15pm while I was looking at selling clothes, someone stole my wallet from my bag. I immediately noticed your security guard that were near the exit . He wasn’t helpful at all, just said”  What can I do?”. You should have cameras and view the recorded immediately because the thief was still in the shopping centre and even in your store to rob some of your other costumers.|0
Absolutely APPALLING customer service!!! Would never shop here again. This is the flagstore in London and was shocked to recieve such poor customer service by its sales assistant.  Waited in the queue for more than 20 minutes on the main floor with only 3 Sales Assistants on the till with over 20 customers waiting to be served.  When I eventually reached the top of the queue one the SA’s signed out leaving only 2 members of staff on the tills. What appealed to be a manager, mumbled over tanoy for other SA’s to come onto the tills, no one arrived, the music was also too loud. Waited a further 10 minutes to FINALLY be served with what was an insensitive and crass SA. When I complained to her she was unapologetic, inconsiderate and unconcerned with the fact that loyal customers had been waiting for more than 20/30mins.  Wouldn’t recommend this store in a million years. Its a shame as H&M clothes are lovely and as the flagship store that represents London/England it has been thoroughly let down by its lack of well trained curteous staff. P|0
The staff has forgotten the tag on the clothes,didn't realised until I got home. So I had to returned and waisted 2H traveling because of staff mistake. The manger has just appologies,belived it should have been fair to pay for my time|0
Rubbish customer service who laugh in your face for mistakes they make very unprofessional staff need training on communication and manners|0
I went to Westfield Stratford I  always enjoy shopping at H&M  today I  went to the store I been served by lady called Diena I bought two item to exchange one item was over 27 days I am only allowed to exchange I said that’s fine when I bought new clothes she lift it on the and asked me to pay the deference then I said why did you not exchange she said in a rude way I already made the transaction I said then you have to refund this trouser and then  I can exchange the item she gave me a dirty look I said you waste my time  and yours time she rippled back in a rude way if you are not happy leave your feedback on the website and then I said you are rude can I see your manager she called the manager I said she is rude to me guy working next tell his name was T.J response was to me you are rude I saw you manger standing out there and doing nothing and everyone in the shop are watching us I said this is very unprofessional manger didn’t say nothing apart for that what need to do I said leave it and he said its fine you can go lady I said I think your staff need costumer service training while I am leaving Dienien gave me a  dirty smirk  and no  apologise.|0
Very very slow on the tills. Lack of staff. If paying in cash is a nightmare waiting ages just to pay for 2 things|0
I happened to venture into there new store in Stratford,. Why do they put woman's clothing next to the mens ? I found the men's section  cluttered and disorganised with a boring selection. I was informed by the staff when I managed to find one, to look online. What!!!        Poor customer service|0
Whenever im buying anything from H&M the clothes after 3-4 weeks are not suitable to use anymore. Plenty of holes everywhere etc. Can't believe that primark is way better in terms of quality...|0
Nice style poor poor quality for the prices they have!|0
HATE THIS STORE.THE SECURITY GUARD IS USELESS AND THE STORE MANAGER ON THE BOTTOM FLOOR IS SO RUDE AND RACIST!! MY PHONE GOT STOLEN AND STORE MANAGER DIDNT CARE MADE ME GO THROUGH MORE STRESS. NEVER HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH THAT MUCH DISRESPECT I USE TO LOVE GOING TO THIS STORE BEFORE. NEVER AGAIN!!! MADE A COMPLAINT TO HEAD OFFICE!!|0
Staff can't calculate, I bye 3 for to, 2 of them £6 one £8, and I returned that from £8 for oder from £6, and payed them more re money how is possible I will never shop for h&m on Stratford|0
Poor shopping experience as the staff were non existent and disengaged.|0
Ordered something on-line. Wanted to return at the store as item not as expected. Was advised I need to contact with the customer service after paying for the parking and spending time in a long queue. Very disappointed.|0
Very poor customer service , was there on Friday 2 November 2018 between ( 6/7pm) , they had no bags in store . Manager just keep saying sorry, No action , top of that they charged me 5p for a small paper bag ???? I thought we get charged just for plastic ?? Felt so horrible , I had lot of stuff couldn’t fit everything ( jackets / jeans / jumpers ) in small 5p bags . End up carrying everything in my hand ... so discussed|0
Clothes are nice but music is far too loud. I see people leaving after having their eardrums burst just by walking into the store.|0
Closing the fitting rooms att 45? Make me sad that costumer service is this bad. Not that sad about the fact that I'm not coming back tho.|0
Came in for click and collect. After waiting for 10 minutes at the pick up point I had to queue up in order to speak to a member of staff. Who then sent me back to the collection point and after a few minutes a very rude girl name Adina came and made the experience even worse. I am extremely disappointed with the level of service provided.|0
Rudest workers I’ve ever had to interact with.|0
Everything in there is designed to make you feel ugly.  It is terrible. Do not enter.|0
Shelves look like a jumble sale. Staff rude, pushing past customers and grumpy at checkouts|0
Google map pin is in the wrong location. This store is in Westfield Stratford. Not near Liverpool Street station|0
Plenty of metallica t-shirts but no metallica hoodie. Disappointed|0
Not great|0
Worst hm in the world, staff is rude, the place is a mess, don't go there for the love of god|0
It was awful experience during covid. Especially,  manager Erica!|0
Every time I've popped into H&M, I've come across a store with no sales assistants.|0
Very busy, nothing special, lots of sales but nothing that jumps out at you|0
Not a great selection of man's clothing while female have two three floors..|0
Never there!|0
Very Bad customer service, staff not professional, no manners|0
Is there any staff who actually work here|0
Rude staff in fitting rooms.|0
Poor service|0
Didn't go there|0
Loud music makes it difficult to hear and be heard.|0
Worst company|0
Not there|0
Too crowded|0
Small size|0
Rubbish|0
This is the wrong location!|0
Absolute chaos|0
Staff were so incredibly rude as if the atmosphere in and H&M isn’t already awful enough. The new self check out is ridiculous and I felt judged by staff for not being able to use it properly like I’m supposed to know the procedures.|0
Very little choice, no helpful staff in sight|0
They make poor quality clothes|0
"I visited on the 24th and bought a few items. The store itself was clean and everything was easy to find. I went to pay in the men's section. I was third in line. A member of staff highly encouraged us to use the self-service rather than speak to a person, quickly explained the process, and said she'd get me a bag.  I scanned the first item, no luck, had to wait for the staff member. She's next to me, explaining to a man and woman how they're not using it right. It's at this point the staff member says, ""Let him do it. Men are better at it."" I was mortified. The staff member then has to stand and scan all my items for me as none of the barcodes work. She walks off as I pay and I am left waiting for a bag. I have to alert the cashier I originally wanted to buy from and they get me a bag instead. All three people could have been served by the cashier in half the time if this staff member had just left us alone.  Upon arriving home, I realize they haven't removed the security tags from two of my items. I now have to go back out (I'll be going to my local one in Norwich, not this one!!) and get the tags taken off before I can wear my purchase.  Awful service and I can't believe what was said by your staff."|0
The cashier and some of the staff were racially profiling customers (black and brown mostly) and treated them differently  had a very bad experience|0
Very disappointed with 16th century fashion that has arrived at H&M. Quality of clothes is a lot of the time questionable. However the shop is tidy and staff is nice|0
I wanted school uniform and they had nothing. Thought they should of had a range at least. Its a really big store.|0
"Beautiful range of clothing and sizes the only problem was the staff at the tills. Approached the tills with my items and two young girls were completely ignoring my presence while serving me talking about Harry Potter and what houses they were in 😂 the only thing I got from the girls were ""thats £15"" and a ""bye"" after i paid. Either the manager didn't care for how they treat customers or they just have the poorest customer service skills ever and should the company should reconsider their staff or get them retrained 😂😂"|0
Store layout makes no sense, it is hard to find items and the never seems to be any staff on the shop floor to ask for help.|0
Hardly any staff and only has plus sizes online and not instore which is quite discriminatory for modern day.|0
Am starting to not like shopping here.. They seem to cater to people that only wear slim fit jeans pants.. I can't find a boot cut or straight fit Jean's pants to safe my life.. and they only had one Jacket line like really summer is over where are the winter collections?|0
"You'd think with this new much bigger store they'd have more staff but they don't. There's always a queue on every floorostly because these rarely more than 3 people on the check out. Because it's a new store staff don't know where anything is and seem unwilling to show you. I was simply directed to ""upstairs"" when I asked for something. Went check out and even tho the queue was more than 20 people deep, someone actually jumped off the cashier to hang clothes up. Very annoyed!"|0
Untidy shop with no customer service|0
Don’t like self check out. I’d rather be served by a human.|0
Disgustingly busy, but it's the weekend. Good range of clothes, even if not my style. The service was slow, even for a weekend. I'd avoid this place at all costs.|0
The H&M home section in the Stratford branch is beautiful, but the staff in the Home section are so unwelcoming. No smile and they make you feel awkward. Really puts me off going there.|0
it so so there is  not much things in a.y stores|0
Although this branch has homeware, nightware, lingerie, sports and the usual Men, Women and Children's, I was not impressed. Been to better laid out and stocked branches.|0
The quality of clothes has gone down drastically since the pandemic, what a shame, it used to be my favourite store|0
Never staff to help you. It's almost like they are shortly staffed|0
Not much for grown ups here.|0
Would give a 4 if they didn't leave security tags on items second time a row!|0
Customer service is terrible!|0
good collection but bad customer service during the Christmas, she didn't even look at me, and it wasn't busy.|0
It's good|0
Nothing available over a 12. Staff difficult to find and disinterested.|0
No options for petite taille|0
Poor customers service|0
Goood|0
Always busy|0
The store is large and has a variety of goods, but the prices are very high|0
Good prices but looking for clothes by size on the label is a struggle|0
I find that this H&M is not layed out very well. They hardly have any clothing to choose from for boys over 8 years old. The options were very poor and same for ladies clothing. Styles are very boring and I have not been able to find anything I like in this place. H&M used to be my favourite store but I haven't been able to find anything I like for months! There weren't many to choose from.|1
This is a big store and they usually have a huge collection of clothes. The prices are usually affordable. The staff are helpful and try to find the clothes for you if you have any difficulty.|1
Nice big store, missus couldnt find anything she liked bar the home section. Mens section was pretty poor tbh from style to quality and 60quid for cargo bottoms.... have a laugh|1
It was massive as they have 1 on each level. I got there around 5:30pm and they close at 6pm so I did my shopping then it was 5:58 that's when the security came to me pushing  me to get out like he would literally intimidate you to get out even when I had something to pay for.  They clothes are okay  but the nice ones are hidden so you have to spend a lot of time looking.|1
Store it is impecable, although i wont give full stars as i think full experience isnt just about presentation of the store which was great, although girls at the cashier were chatting in between then and not paying attention to the customers, lady no did eye contact,, did not asked me for my customer account for point collection, i was basically doing the job for her. Not really nice, i believe this needa to be managed|1
Brightly lit store with a great layout but their range is simply too 'highstreet' for me. However, you do get what you pay for, is always well stocked and great customer service.|1
I visited to see the items which I saw online but had a hard time locating. I will most likely continue shopping online instead. There was a different layout but I haven't been to this branch in months.|1
I love H&M but need who staff work more customer, I saw some them didn't know self check, staff rude show scan them then they left item lol.|1
Tis was a good experience. They have social distancing in place also the staff are nice. I was waiting in the queue and the young lady at the till was taking forever like super forever. Then another young lady came over and opened up another till, she served me and the original till lady was still serving that same customer. So a nice touch there of customer service.|1
I shop here often, quality is great and so is customer service except one aspect. Usually when I drop clothes off for a voucher I quickly get served and all is good. Today, during busy hours, when I went to drop clothes off for a voucher the staff were awkwardly aware of my presence. After waiting for 10mins I got someones attention and I was told I was supposed to get in the queue. Luckily I was given a voucher immediately due to the inconvenience which I appreciate. But next time staff should be more aware.|1
Came here a few days ago and was bringing some clothes for my friend into her changing room. The lady behind the desk at the changing rooms had a bad attitude towards customers and wouldn’t let me go towards the changing room my friend was in and had a go at me for trying. I didn’t get her name but she has a strong foreign accent.  Other staff members were lovely but this one...  not so much.|1
It was nice and clean. Fitting room staff in the top floor, children section were not enough helpful as they supposed to be. I couldn't buy the clothes which I was interested.|1
Nice shop.... got some pretty stuffs|1
I love this store,it's clean and tidy things are easy to find which is just as well as when I was there the staff were very busy chatting to each other and didn't seen to want to help the shoppers! The security guard on the other hand was very helpful. There wasn't any staff in the changing rooms,it was like a jumble sale in there, very disappointed.. More staff training needed maybe!!|1
The shop is nice having vast variety of cloths. You can get clothes of your choice here at reasonable prices.|1
Good size store, I assumed it would stock a bigger range due to the size of the store. The children department is disappointing as it seems very small. The store is always neat and tidy when I visit. Would be good to have more people serving when busy.|1
New store is a lot better, but the person who came up with the idea of those annoying curtains in the changing rooms is quite silly. 1) they don't fully close 2) the curtains are closed at times even if no ones inside 3) mirrors everywhere so a small gap is very exposing 4) the shop floor assistant opened the curtains on me while I was changing even though the curtains were fully shut. Just save customers the hassle and build standard lockable cubicles.|1
Trailing round after my wife who actually bought something 😳 …|1
Affordable fashion in general, didn't like how unstructured the jackets were...tried a few, didn't buy any...disappointed as I liked the fabrics/ patterns.|1
It's ok , could do with a bit more variety as the stock  looks the same every time you visit 😂 …|1
Did a lot of walking around trying to find things, didn't  appear  to have specific areas , to me it was a muddle.|1
Big store but quene up for fitting room for long time, don't know why they don't open other floor of fitting room as such a large amount of customers waiting|1
Nice store. Very big. Clothes could be organised better.|1
The Stratford Westfield H&M is huge, has lots of variety of things, but there is always a huge queue for the checkouts whenever I've been. Not great when you were hoping to grab something quickly in your lunch break or before heading home from work.|1
Was good, got what I needed on a blazing hot day! Escaped the masses because luckily this shop is at the front. 2021 beh beh.|1
Visited to get a gift card.|1
It’s a lovely place|1
Music is always too loud|1
Wasn't really too happy they didn't have many men's where's especially when it comes to the jeans|1
Good staff not my sort of clothes.|1
Okayish range of clothing however zero. Staff presence of floors, one has to literally scour the floors to find some help.|1
Clothes shop... took mum to return some stuff she bought for my nephew. Clothes were too small ... growing baby|1
Nice stuff but too much busy when I visited.|1
Not a good collection|1
Very busy and the best lines often sell out quickly.|1
Needs a new designer. The clothes are a bit boring nothing I'd really want to buy|1
Not bad but can be better quality and style|1
Was always a good place to shop. Something has changed though... Probably the economy has affected the life of these places|1
No one to ask for help.|1
I like this shop. But why does the candles have no smell when burning|1
Like their ranges. My favourite cargo trousers. Great comfy casual gear|1
Ridiculously long queues, worse than store before. Would be nice to see actual takes not crop tops so much.|1
Nice shop but size are small so get one size bigger|1
Clothes can reasonably priced but it's just too busy and hardly any staff around to help.|1
Not a huge range of clothes but good customer service.|1
Like all the h&m but i found there all i wanted so it is a bigger one.|1
The staff members gathered up and talking about what he is going to be cooking tonight and everyone  (other staff) are ganged around him and laughing with each other rather than helping customers.  One lady asked for different size the worker goes it's all sold out. But soon as the lady walked away this girl in scarf said to another colleague man I can't be bothered to show her around there some more people's. Overalls there was plenty of staff but not hard workers they were useless for the customers services.|1
I been a here a few time but sadly couldn't get help from the staff|1
The music is too  loud makes it hard to shop at least  for me...Wasn't able to find the jeans I wanted and such a shame no student discount|1
1 lift for all the mummies with buggies and the staff. Not really helpful|1
Good but they need to do a lot|1
Good prices, service is none existence|1
Did not have what I was looking for. The boys section is so small.|1
Not much decent clothing in the girls range.|1
Like all H&M clothes are daily priced.|1
Nice job 👌 …|1
Great for girls clothes, not so much for boys|1
Not so organised.|1
Not my stylebut nice if you look for casual dress|1
Plain clothes and always busy. Hard to find staff|1
bad service but got a nice shirt so can't fault it|1
Better than Next and River Island|1
An alright H&M store. Staff ok, store bit smaller than other branches.|1
good|1
Ok ok collection was there|1
Quality for what you paid. Bur less size available|1
Useful for recycling|1
Not much for older ladies|1
Not a huge selection for tweens|1
Not the right shop for me|1
Not enough staff and not very helpful.|1
Did not find good deals for the children.|1
Usual hnm|1
Alway able to find something I like.|1

Its H&M|1
Just okay.|1
The prices are very high for the quality of the clothes.|1
Hay mucha mercancía pero por el hecho de no haber sido tratada correctamente por un empleado, tuve que irme con las manos vacías.  There is a lot of merchandise but due to the fact that I was not treated correctly by an employee, I had to leave empty handed.|1
High prices, the selection of goods and sizes is not adjusted|1
Mehhh|1
Fair|1
God shopping|1
HM|1
Two floor H& M store ground floor ladies and first floor mens and children. Has decent variety of clothing for all age and gender.|1
Beautiful vibrant clothes. Clean, neat and tidy. Parking available located in Westfield Shopping centre (Stratford). Food courts  available.|1
A current fashion- house. Liked by the younger population which it serves well. Good displays and decent staff. It's a part of the Westfield complex with all its amenities.|1
I have always found this shop very reliable as well as decent fashion. I am a man, so I come in one day in search of a kimono. I found a cream coloured one that also had a price cut to £20. I bought it and it matches my style, holla at your boy, bless.|1
Large well kept store definitely one of the better h&m stores about|1
Huge selection of clothing for men, women and children, although they left the security tag on an item, not a single person to assist me when the alarm went off at the door.|1
I'm looking forward to getting my beautiful sequin dress here ear to wear for a night out out this weekend. It costs £35 and it's ridiculously gorgeous.|1
A well managed store for men and women cloth and accessories.|1
Good choice of clothes etc Staff was ok|1
Perfect time to visit this store, I would say is early morning literally within the first or second hour of opening. Store was organised and not too busy so was able to have a good look around. A large range of items across the three levels. Women's clothes dominant the store of course and you can find something to suit any budget and age. They also have a small beauty section. Store is pretty amazing carrying accessories, swimwear, lingerie, footwear, sports wear, children's wear, men's and even a small  home section. Staff on tills are friendly and really helpful with a query I had. Didn't have what I went in for (beauty item) but came out with other things I needed. Good overall store.|1
Two floor H& M store ground floor ladies and first floor mens and children.|1
Good winter collection 👌.  Reasonable price. …|1
The shop is on sales this Summer.. a good time to visit.  The counter lady was so pleasant and customer friendly.|1
Limited stuff for men and not always the best quality the but during sales you can grab a good bargain|1
Good range of summer wear. Really good prices and the quality is good too.|1
Always something wonderful and reasonably priced|1
My favourite store and is a big branch and I love the variety but once more I'll say the same thing the there's not enough staff on the shop floor to help customers.|1
Good stuff for ladies and children.|1
Picked up some things for my daughter as H&M stock a size 4 and my daughter is very slim, which is great. My only issue coming from a retail background is the staff on the tills in most shops. They always look so miserable! I understand working long hours and some customers can be quite testing, however, some of these people need to may be work on their customer service skills! Or just simple smiles would be a good start!!!|1
I've shopped at H&M since the 90s and always return for the shopping experience of space, good floor visual merchandising and great products and good prices. However the last 2 visits have been disappointing with very ordinary stock and poorer quality fabrics and choices. It seems the company is hedging oooh the safe bet with nothing interesting or quirky in stock. So I'm not purchasing as there's nothing I can't get anywhere else at equally good prices. Pity really.|1
The good the bad & ugly of shopping in H&M, 1st the good, l always find great clothes at reasonable prices 2nd the bad, you can't find any staff to help with sizes everything is really self service 3rd the ugly, l bought a suit at full price about four weeks later it had gone down to half price 🤔 l deserve a badge for sticking with H&M|1
Nice prices well stocked. Expect to queue if you need to use fitting room, one till takes cash as others card only, not over crowded.|1
Nice store. Lots of choice. Wife loves all their clothes. Great maternity selection. Love the their glass lit lift the best tho. You must check it out. Proper physechelic|1
It was nice going in there, seeing all the different things they've got. I didn't get the dress I was looking for though 😁 …|1

It is a good store. I enjoied scanning through items and I found what I needed and purchased.|1
Great for kids shopping,  i always find good stuff for my toddlers. Not much stuff for newborns though.|1
Situated in Westfield shopping centre. You will find cheap clothes|1
Just a quick pop in and out. Not to crowded and didn't find what I was looking for.  Overall it was fine.|1
My daughter got got lucky here with a pair of cut-offs from the sale rack which fit her perfectly when she tried them on. Okay ambience - less snooty and bombastic than Topshop and not frenetic and headache inducing like Westfield's Primark. My daughter didn't like shop mixtape though.|1
Its a nice shop as well where lots of collections are available although price little bit high|1
There is a lots of Hijabi tunics and dresses.|1
Nice shop clean very well laid out. Good fitting rooms. Not too busy but bought nothing feeling poor hence 4 stars.|1
Nice store not as big as expected but good|1
Needs more staff in areas but overall amazing place to shop peacefully|1
Cheap and best|1
The layout of the store is a bit confused other than that store is good enough that it has menswear and home collection.|1
Average HM store. Often lack size S in a lot of items, but still ok.|1
Always good selection of sizes in all products!  And staff always friendly & helpful!|1
Good space with good options . I love the homeware section more|1
Staff genuinely trying to be helpful but the store layout was confusing even for them.|1
Love the brand. I mostly buy my jeans here. If you want to keep up with the latest but affordable fashion; you should be shopping here.|1
Not too busy but hard social distancing in the shop which is the problem and not everyone cares about that. The shopping experience was good and lots on sale to choose from.|1
Always great to catch a look...... Homestuff is good looking!|1
Love this place always find something there i like.|1
The lights in store are very hot but a lovely shop for kids clothes great value for money|1
Lovely range of menswear on the cheaper side than some other stores nearby.|1
One of my favourite shop to buy to do shopping for my children|1
Always a good vibe in H&M good quality contemporary styles at prices that won't break the bank.|1
A small H&M but still managed to find a product and in my size.  Bear in mind, they only have one of each clothing almost in one in each size.  A very clean store.|1
Love a bit of H&M but there was not enough sleep suits  for my baby 12-18 months and or a wide range.|1
I didn't actually go in there, but I do like the shop.|1
Didn't buy anything, I just went to have a look and see what the place is about, loads of stuff some of it I would buy some I would not but that is down to taste anyway, I can't really comment on the staff and service as I had no interaction with them but the place looked alright.|1
Quite good brand and prices are reasonable, product design and qualities also good, I like the seasonal clothes especially kids clothes are   Nice subjected to heath and safety.|1
Busy but clothes are nice. Domt go during peak hours|1
Good sized store, with lots to offer.  Staff are helpful and friendly, despite it being very busy!|1
Lots of option for clothing.two floors as well|1
Good prices and not too bad clothes.|1
Great year end sales, very bright lights, many designs, I bought many kids clothing value for money..|1
I went during the sale and was pleased to find some amazing items.  Perhaps I won't have bought otherwise if not for the sale.|1
Good nail varnish selection. Love their jewelry and home section as well. They do have some good buys.|1
New location is fantastic|1
Cleanly store, perfectly priced, tasteful fashion. Same standard you would find globally. Whats not to like.|1
Clean not too crowded, friendly staff|1
Well stock, clean and tidy with tons of variety. Would defo go again. Staff are pleasant and helpful.|1
I saved £200 pounds when bought stuff on sale after Christmas! Came handy to give gifts when I went on holidays !|1
Great clothes for kids. Wish there was more choice for boys (although this applies to all other retailers too).|1
Very clean and spacious. The people work in there is helpful.|1
Awesome store, I don't like that sometimes you have to wait way to much at the lift|1
Great store, big one, find for my 11 years old daughter what she need exactly . Thanks H&M|1
Good quality clothing for reasonable prices just wish they had more midi dresses|1
Quick and helpful staff, clean shop. Still no fitting rooms...|1

Very pleasent experience. Staff very helpful with my query and locates my item.|1

Found some really good stuff on sale as well.|1
Looking for shirt for 14 year couldnt find his age. Also mens size small too big|1

Great store...|1
The quality of products is good, worth to buy it.|1
Brilliant store. Great customer services.  Helpfully staff.|1

Massive store at Stratford Westfield. Decent prices. Lots of items to choose from.|1
This location in Westfield is always tidy, no clothes on the ground and the staff is very helpful|1
Cheaply made clothes at cheap-ish price, like a up market primark.|1
Well stocked but no structure to what is where|1
Went in for a quick visit, had to wait round for tills to be opened.|1
Lots of choice not too busy|1
Liked this shop...it was clean and got some offer...|1
Good store. Alot of collection.|1

Amazing fitting rooms|1
There are always dirty items (shirts, coats) whenever I am shopping there and am about to try something out.|1
Cool place. Not much in the Mens formal range|1
Good selection of clothes,  reasonable prices|1
The place is ok|1
One of My wife's favourite shopping spots|1

The store on Oxford Street in London, a large selection, the sales team is neither courteous nor helpful|1
Excellent ready to wear store.|1
Fairly large store with a lot of choice (women - men - children). The prices are not too high, the sellers are pleasant and polite but there is often a long wait in front of the fitting rooms on weekends|1
Great deals, impossible to enter this store and not buy anything, clean and organized. Kind employees.|1

Store theft|1
Very bad customer service at this store in London. If you are not in a hurry go to the H&M store at Oxford street. The guys standing at the paying counter made us go back in the line after standing for 15 minutes for no reason. He just did not look at the line and moved us back. Customer Rep or sales guy name is talal. When we brought this issue up there was an Indian/pakistani guy who was super rude with us and told us you should just break the line. I would suggest visiting better stores around with better customer support. Pathetic after spending almost 150 pounds this was not worth the treatment.|0
Terrible staff who were openly giving out about doing their jobs. No assistance with self-checkout. Didn’t see anywhere for tag removal and ended up leaving with tags on my items. Alarms went and the security guard just told us to head on. He didn’t think for a second that someone who has never done self -checkout for clothing may have left a tag on. Great stock but the staff are incompetent.|0
Really disappointed with my experience at this store today. I saw 3 very sad looking plants reduced at £3 at the “last chance” section. I thought I’d save one and get a bargain at the same time. When I went at the till the manager rudely explained these were placed there by mistake and cost £22 each. I find this extremely overpriced for a dying plant. And there was lot of other sad looking overpriced plants too. I would not recommend plant shopping from H&M.|0
I really love this shop so much however I went to return a bed set recently and was quite shocked at how rude the staff were. They said I couldn’t return it because it wasn’t in its packaging - she asked me I wanted to return it because it wasn’t the right size. I said no it didn’t suit my room and she continued to say “you should really know the size of your bed before you purchase” - first of all not what I said and second of all, SO rude? She then said I can exchange it… why is it now acceptable for an exchange and not return?|0
Seriously the MOST RUBBISH lint roller i have ever used!! Cant even tear it properly where the dotted line is. Cheap things always turned out to be more costly and makes one more angry.|0
Had NOTHING instore worth buying. Looked on EVERY level from all around the shop floor- A waste of time. Ended up going to a completely different store where some nice items of clothing were purchased.|0
Dangerously overcrowded when I went there yesterday. H&M Home Store was packed and no one was following the one way system. Children running around. Staff and security guards did not social distance from customers. Store was packed with so much merchandise and it's not even possible to walk past someone without being face to face inches away. And can't order online since lotsa stuff are out of stock in the app or online. Disappointing shopping experience all round.|0
Took forever to find a changing room that opened. The staff working in the changing room was super rude and dismissive.|0
the secutity man is very rude. i was simply asking where can i find kids corner and he looked quite annoyed. He even kinda yelled at me. I know i see the sign of kids but was so in rush just wanted to get quick help. He ruined my shopping|0
Service in women's wear was good, staff were quite helpful, however the staff up in menswear were so rude and unhelpful. Service made me feel very uncomfortable and as though the staff were being forced to work. Really disappointing considering this is one od my favourite stores. Will not be coming to this branch again.|0
Very disappointed that H&M+ has been discontinued in store and is only available online!  This is pure discrimination to women size 18+ who will now not be able to shop at your stores at all.  Disgusting!|0
Was moved on my a member of staff as I was resting (heavily pregnant with twins) told to go to the changing rooms. Terrible.|0
My experience at Stratford shopping branch of H&M started fine on the day I shopped. However, I soon realised that one garment was scanned twice and when I went back into the store to rectify the mistake. The manager made me feel as if I was lying and she looked into my face and said let me check the CCTV. She came back without any apology just''sorry for keeping you waiting i will refund your money now. Is this the same treatment given to all customers? I will not be shopping in that branch again|0
I used to love H&M and shopping online. But recently when I ordered a parcel, it was supposed to be delivered by company Yodel. It was terrible, they didn't deliver me anything, so I had to go all the way from London to Kent to take my parcel on my day off! I wasted whole day and money on the train tickets. Why this company even exists if I had to do their job? I mean, H&M was closer to me than the depot... I won't be shopping in H&M anymore until it doesn't work with this terrible company.|0
No clear signage for what floor men’s department was. Get down there and the service was so slow. Took over 10 mins to be served and I was first on line!!!|0
Loads of customers are dissappointed by yesterday's balmain event. Poorly managed staffs who totally misguided customers. I expect floods of complaint n reduce their stars to 0 bcoz this store will badly damage H&M image in long term.|0
Placed an order 2 weeks ago and i havent even received an email saying it has been posted out yet. Was told it would arrive next day delivery. After all, that is what i paid for.  AVOID AT ALL COST  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.|0
Staff not helpful. I asked at the checkout if there was another size of the item j was buying. Girly was rude asked if I looked around the store. Then said no.|0
Poor and rude customer service from staff in the menswear department on floor 1 of the H&M clothes store on Regent Street. A lot of attitude shown to not only to myself but others who were being served in all three queues. How all three staff members got jobs in customer facing roles astounds me.|0
I was in the queue on 4th floor and there was 1 lady only in the cashier. I decided to try the cashier on 3rd floor, it was closed. On the 2nd, closed. So I went back to 4th. Still one lady and when a second one came the first one left. At least 8 people in the queue. It took longer for me to pay than to find and try it on the dress I wanted.|0
"Yesterday 26 of december 2015   So hard to gave 1 star """" they need to put option of """"Mines"""" yesterday i had a shopping on the stor and i put all my shopping to the cashier .. i paid... and i want to get an other pair off shoes , i said to the cashier i will get an other one... i went i came back .. i didnt find the first pair wich i already paid..??? She was looking everywhere.. was not ther ..  cause the cashier  she is new and she is not even talk proper english .,;;;  she get an other lady to ask her for help  .. that lady said she will tcheeque the camera !!... she came back saying in the camera looks like i took the shoes..and she said she need to tcheeque in my bag !!!!! She was thing to find the shoe's in my bag  .. she is such a stupid ... i could not enderstand that .. and she had a look and no shoes was ther then its my turn to play bad words  ::: such a lier she said she saw me in camera taking the shoes and she didnt see wer is the shoes and she said the shoes is not on the store  !°¿°¿  do i have magic stupid cashier . She was  sckinny with long curly hair 😕😕😕😕😕..  dont worry i m going on holiday and when i back i will get everything sorted by lawyer..."|0
Changing rooms closed, so I'll buy elsewhere 👍 …|0
This shop sucks. I was told to leave or carry my dog (she's 22 kilos, BTW), though no sign at the entrance said so. They're just plain prejudiced, in here.|0
How can this company say they are ecofriendly and “conscious”? When they give you LARGE PLASTIC BAGS!!!! This is pure greenwashing|0
Picked up order.took longer than looking round shop for items.need to improve|0
Very bad service, nobody was willing to help me find the size I needed, some members of the staff could barely speak English and others were really rude. Disappointed.|0
Your shop hours on google say you’re open until 10pm on a Saturday but you were closed by 9:20.|0
Slowest service i have ever experienced. Really not worth visiting the store.|0
Clothes are terrible, customer service are useless and staff members needs to learn to take the sacurity tag off|0
The garments looks the same year after year.... the staff never says hi... the sizes weird... hmmm|0
"Men's Department Let me quote my boyfriend: ""When you got 5 levels, you can shove the men in the basement in only one floor, in the dark"" The layout was a disaster, I think (as a woman) there should've been broader choices for smart/formal wear. But the worst part was the darkness and NO MIRRORS. The lights were so dim, I kept seeing dark green whenever something was actually a black piece of clothing. AND YES: - NO MIRRORS. NO ACTUAL MIRRORS. Whoever was the interior designer, should get fired. They decided the columns of the building should get covered in ""mirrors"". While this works relatively good in the upper levels, in the ladies section - bright, proper classic mirror ""coloured"" mirrors there-, underground this ""mirror"" is one of those dark-grey/black reflective surfaces WHICH ALREADY CAN'T REFLECT NOTHING BECAUSE OF THE POOR LIGHTING!! And besides - even if the lights were turned on properly (what's up, saving power? why not candlelight?...!) it still isn't a plain mirror, it is this dark tinted stuff! How the hell do you expect people to see if the blue matches your eyes? ... Shame that in a world-class shopping street such blasphemy exists from H+M!! *insert here GoT shame .gif* Good day!"|0
Be careful with sales, they put full price items in between and then act like they don’t know anything.|0
Not enough for men|0
1 star for unpleasant staff. Have been here 3 times in the run up for Christmas, and they may be overworked, but been always rude. An example being: there isn't a living soul at the tills in the men's department, so you go one floor up, where they tell you, that the men's are one floor down, but in the end they do the return just the same. Another example: you queue for the till to pay, where there are three cashiers in action, then after all the waiting the till gets closed by the shop assistant right in front of you, no explanations or apologies given. Guys, this is really poor, but you'll be happy: I'll spend my money elsewhere next time.|0
Staff members lost their tongue, they can´t say hello to anyone.|0
A really poor selection of clothes in plus sizes... What a same..|0
Terrible customer service by manager on duty|0
staff here must hate their job, and it shows|0
very bad|0
Not the home store|0

Racist staff|0

The music is so loud I suspect they're somehow trying to keep customers away 😢 I couldn't even have a proper look around the store because it was unbearable 😕 …|0
"You are obliged to leave your things with the ""responsible"" of the fitting room and when you leave she simply loses your necklace and still blames you, as if you had lost the necklace. They should review the staff urgently!!!!!!!"|0
Ummm idk why no cloth is fully organised and you can see 8 different design of a pants in same rack… also if you want a different size the answer is no-no|0
Clothes wern't displayed in an appealing and easy to find items. Sizes were very limited and Helpers were very limited in number. I won't go there again|0
"I went to buy a bag for my Mum (xmas present) 3 weeks ago. When I went to pay for it, the cashier lady who I think had a high status in the shop (manager or something) nodded to another worker next to her as if you say ""look at this teenage girl buying this womanly bag"".I was going to say something but I was in shock. I had done nothing yet encountered such rudeness from staff for no reason ! i just looked at them but they just carried on laughing and giving each other looks. I had been to the store a few times before but after that, i'll happily spend an extra minute to walk to another h&m. They aren't the only one."|0
Music in this shop is so loud I think the staff mistook it for a disco. Had a very hard time shopping with such loud noise in the background, couldn’t hear anything. If you’ve got low noise tolerance or are on a spectrum best to avoid it.|0
I do not like shopping. Although I must say I do like that they let you charge your phone while you stop.|0
Men’s department needs improving. Went to pick up a few cheap polo necks. Had to look hard through the rail to find one without a mark on it. Thought I’d found one, got to the counter to pay and guess what.....noticed a mark on the sleeve. Cashier also left a security tag on one item so the alarm went off at the door and I had to go back inside and have them remove it.  A big store with a decent selection of the usual H&M stuff but not a great experience.|0
Store opens at 1130, but checkout counters don't open till 12.  This isn't clearly marked though.  The checkout counters are also inconveniently located.|0
Needed a carrier bag as the one I was given had broken. Was then quizzed about which items I bought before having to PURCHASE another carrier bag.|0
For a flagship store in Regent Street, it's lacking in 'customer experience' and speciality.|0
Not the best one around..small men department|0
Small section for men|0

Huge store ... Different sections for all... Not well presented ... The other H&M store on oxford street is faaaaar better.|1
3 floors of affordable clothing in a spacious, clean and modern store.|1
H&M Home is alright. Busy place due to being on regent Street. Some of the staff are nice and some just can’t be bothered so they have their phone in their hand while you ask them stuff. Other than that, they open earlier on Sunday but you won’t be able to pay anything until 12pm due to their license. Don’t waste your time going around and ask to pay before 12pm they won’t do anything about it.|1
First time for me in this store, looks like they have similar good quality as Zara and mango talking about kids area, but the difference was in H&M the variety is mayor than Zara, because I find what I was looking for, after two days of searching, the only thing was my English is so bad for the employés of the store, sorry, I'm not good speaker but I'm a good buyer, but anyway things happen, after hard and ugly day I was thinking in relax myself buying some things for my little kids. But my English was good enough. I recommend you ARKET my God what a beautiful things are here.|1
Very rude staff, but a huge range of clothes.|1
Go in there when my wife is in town. Seems a large spacious, well laid out shop. Good for clothes and accessories. My wife likes it but my credit card doesn't. Joking aside seems a good shop and is always pretty busy.|1
It's a bit to big for my liking and it's all the younger trends as you enter. Younger trends should be higher up on the floors they have more energy to shop around.|1
A fine selection of clothes and accessories but I only had a few minutes to take out all in. Any shop with a dedicated floor of children's clothes really also needs a bathroom. Once we left the shopyto find one, we weren't going back.|1
I'm a fan of H&M generally but this one isn't the best laid out and in this case was all over the place in terms of customer service. It is pretty big but if you don't want to get side eye at the tills, think twice.|1
This H&M is a bit of an odd one - they are obviously trying to appeal to more the more up-market clientèle of Regents Street, so stock more smarter pieces. Unfortunately, the quality is still H&M quality (i.e. not great), so they don't really pull it off. You won't find any super trendy pieces here, but it's okay for basics or accessories.|1
Nice and warm, i go there when it rains to repair and sometimes pop in to charge my phone. Highly recommend|1
Long queues but some nice stuff, some woefully overpriced and some priced adequately.  No problems with returns.  Appears to be short-staffed as it was hard to find a sales assistant.|1
Fine for what it is. A bit messy, but understandable. Queues for paying quite long, as most cashier places were empty|1
There are millions of H&M stores in Oxford Circus, but this one is worth mentioning because it's one of the few that stocks bits and pieces from the H&M home range. Expect to find the usual H&M range across two floors, not to mention a huge queue if you shop at lunchtime.|1
H&M Regent Street is a really good store. It's a good size that there's a lot of choice available. There is also decent staff to help out. It's especially good for sales :)|1
Relatively good value for the price as it's not as expensive as Topshop for expample yet provides very similar quality clothes. On many high streets whcih is useful. Nice tees|1
To be honest I was disappointed Although it's in the middle of London they didn't have a single waistcoat...|1
With an alternative branch so nearby on Oxford Street, there seems little reason to pop into this one... except cleverly they've stocked this H&M with home wear and smarter work wear pieces that you'd don't need but think you want regardless.|1
Very good value for money, please have more wool in your jumpers , happy to pay more for better winter clothes quality|1
Lovely shop, great range of stock except for fun tights which is what I set out to purchase.|1
Hateful experience as far as shipping goes. Poorly marked areas, clothes that look and feel cheap.|1
3 floors of the latest fashions. 2 floors for ladies. The basement for men. A fair amount of choice.|1
Store was very well organized.  Staff were polite, but staff was distracted as store was quite busy.|1
A few nice products but sizes not ver inclusive at all.|1
Nice clothes as long as your small size no nice big lady  lothes at all shame|1
Pretty small on comparison to many other stores of the same chain. That comes with the disadvantage of limited choice.|1
Haiku Review! Oxford Circus drew my wife and I into here. We have too much stuff.|1
Great selection and easier to walk around no long queues.....😀 …|1
I am probably not the right person to say something about shopping stores, but there is a nice place to relax when you wife shops :)|1
Good quality stuff but I didnt find what I was looking for so 3 Stars|1
Tipical H&M shop. Good for women. Average for man|1
Fast fashion is fast fashion, cheap but not great quality|1
Good stuff within your budget..!|1
Wide variety of stuff, nothing nice|1
Big enough but can be hectic|1
Barely any men's selection|1
Too busy for my liking|1
It was ok|1
Chris good other not helpful|1
Typical H&M store.|1
Standard H&M store|1
H&M high street store|1
Meh|1
Pretty basic.|1
Satisfied|1
Always busy|1
Crowded|1
Couldn't find everything but uts nice and tidy|1
The store is big and many sellers want to help. But the store's policy of not returning money, according to them since Brexit, doesn't seem to me... and quite a bit of money could have been saved by doing so.|1
H&M London Unfortunately it is better than the branches of Saudi Arabia Available in a beautiful variety Men are rich in models and summer and winter species|1
Fairly average apart from the cleanliness which is poor and the shortage of staff.|1
Lugar agradable, los precios son los normales y no hay una silla o sillón para sentarse en todo el local .  Nice place, prices are normal and there is not a chair or armchair to sit in the entire place.|1
Buenos precios, locales amplios, bien cuidados. Una buena opción para comprar ropa y accesorios de uso diario  Good prices, spacious premises, well maintained. A good option to buy clothes and accessories for daily use|1
Un sitio para fanaticos. Muy pintoresco y muy caro  A site for fans. Very quaint and very expensive|1
Just like everywhere, only more people ...|1
Probadores cerrados en la mayoría de las plantas  Closed fitting rooms on most floors|1
Affordable value opportunities|1
Very crowded on weekends|1
Approx|1
👍🏼 …|1
One of the best H&M stores there is. Smart, well stocked, clean, and vibrant, modern design with a huge display wall at the back. Men’s is on the upper level.|1
Nice big shop, lots of clothing available. Went on self checkout, no issues.|1
One of the largest H&M Stores in London and perhaps the only one with the largest section dedicated to kidswear and maternity wear. I love buying children's clothes from here especially the colours for boys are so vibrant! Sleepwear used to be great too but, now the styles have become a bit boring! The reason for 4 stars is because this year the styles are quite dull and drab which could be due to post-lockdown effect, not sure, but pretty disappointing. The queue in the women's fitting room can get busy on the ground floor. The accessories section is good as well but not as good as the branch in Oxford street. Definitely a great place for kidswear. Hope they can bring back the great styles.....|1
very good customer service , i used to work for h and m and service was great|1
Huge branch located right next to Oxford Circus underground.  Loads of floors.  Generally well laid out.  Very nice and bright, welcoming.  Never 'looks' busy as it's so big and spacious.  Staff are pleasant.  I don't often shop at H&M but tend to browse now and again like I did today.  Cheap and quality is fine.  They have some nice things.  Would recommend.|1
Bought outfits from their sale selection|1
Team are fantastic and the layout is easy to understand and find items you're looking for. Their selection is good, store is clean. Only downside is the amount of teams on tills, always one or two and always have to wait 10 mins to be served. Worth it though|1
Big and spacious with a variety of clothes, shoes and accessories. Music playing and a few seating areas on second floor. :)|1
Bright and spacious store with lots of stock! Didn't have xxl size in many mens basic joggers though - as stated on website!|1
I come to this branch for the kids wear. It is usually organised and neat and I normally find great, stylish stuff for my little ones. This branch also has a home section with such lovely items. Staff are helpful and hard working and queues move quite quickly if they build up. This branch is located on regent Street which has some more expensive stores and so it's like a breath of fresh air having an H & M on that line up !|1
Affordable fashion across clothing, lingerie, shoes and accessories. I particularly like this branch as it is  well stocked and surprisingly has ĺess footfall than you would expect given the location, doesn't get crowded out, though you can't say the same for the street outside, always super busy.|1
This is a great store over several floors right next to Oxford Circus. A bit hit and miss for the larger sizes but great product ranges.|1
Out of the 3 stores within walking distance this is the only one that has kids clothing.  Easy store to navigate around and prices are moderate. Quality of materials is excellent and the designs are inspiring.  Staff are helpful.|1
I love their socks, but I wish they did then in a bigger size, they shrink after a couple washes. There was also a problem when purchasing the socks as the cashier didnt apply the 3 for 2 deal, but it's a great shop and ill be returning for more socks|1
Nice little store with a wide range of clothing to choose from. It can get quite busy at times so I would recommend doing your shopping in the morning.|1
Due to the size of the store and it nice staff you will not be disappointed.|1
I'm from the States so we have a lot of H&Ms but these ones have so much more! They are massive and have so many clothes to choose from. I find that they have some different stuff here as well. I dont necessarily like to shop at places that i have at home but because this is so afffordable I figured why not look? I plan on doing a lot more shopping at H&M because I know that I wont be able to get some of the clothes over in the US.|1
Popped in to check out the children's clothes in the sale this week and got some great bargains. The store was relatively tidy considering it was sale time and the prices were comparable with Primark - which is most people's 'go to' place for cheap fashion.|1
Good quality denim shirts and jeans at a reasonable price, and the staff are really helpful.....|1
Just a stone's throw from their store on Oxford Circus, but this one is far superior. It is much bigger and consequently has a much better range of clothing. For guys – look out for their collaborations with big name designers. Whilst the girls are queueing outside to get in, we can go straight upstairs and check out the men's section :)|1
The H&m store is reat and have a very good quality. the childrens cloths are fantastic, very good quality and my children love it very much. there should be more sales prices and somethimes there are diffrences between the stores. the prices are usually ok. i had a problem with the service at the H & M store at the Oxford street. the appeal is not so good|1
Always a good place to shop|1
The fast fashion is definitely upping its game in terms of quality and prices are reasonable|1
H&M was a wonderful store.  They have a great location that is convenient from the Tube.  There is not much men's clothes compared to women.  Prices seem reasonable for London|1
Good value for money, not very busy and many trial rooms available.|1
Wide range of womens, mens, childrenswear and homewares at affordable prices. Can get a bit crowded and untidy at sale times and changing rooms are closed during sale.|1
At the moment it is the only H&M store with plus size H&M+ in Central London and the selection of clothes is not very extensive. I´d appreciate if H&M had a plus size store locator because it is quite difficult to find them|1
Good sale deals and nice clothes for men. The only downside is that the largest shoes size for men is 45.|1
Classy yet affordable|1
Love it, H&M flagship store, but music is unnecessary in my view. Also, not many shoes. Where's all the shoes?|1
Some of staff are so lovely and helpful others are just plain arrogant and rude. However, love the products, hence I keep coming back.|1
Stumbled over the pleat cafe in the home department. Great coffee and hot chocolate, but only 6 tables so very cosy.|1
H&M is a great shop for cheap good quality clothes. It's very nicely priced. Perfect location in London and aways busy.|1
"I like this H&M. There are a lot of sections, also a curvy one. But the selection of ""plus size"" pieces is not the best."|1
Clean and spacious shop. Here you can make a bargain|1
They have great styles and nice prices|1
This store, it's my jam. It's one of he biggest H&Ms in London and has lots of items in stock before some of the other stores. My only issue is that I may not find what I'm looking for when I pop in even if they have new stock weekly. The staff are usually okay.|1
They don't always have all the sizes. Not the biggest choice for shoes and accessories but it is always less busy than the Oxford Street one.|1
A very large H&M store in a very busy part of london. It can get very busy during peak times, however it will have what you want.|1
Very nice specially when there's sale Like today the report price quality is very good|1
Good variety of clothes, shoes, etc. Affordable prices|1
Busy but cool place to visit ,plenty of shopping for the granddaughters.|1
Great bargains to be had, needs to pay more attention to offer more larger sizing choices, fit and at times better quality.|1
Best h&m i've been to - the staff were helpful, no attitude, the clothes were well stocked and the store was very tidy|1
I had a pleasant experience visiting this Swedish warehouse|1
Nice selection of clothing at good prices|1
Large variety of options and much easier than the Oxford Circus outlet which gets a lot busier.|1
Great home store with reasonable prices. Quality is ok.|1
H&M finally!! Had options to buy for kids....I had been to atleast 5 retailers before that and all of them had very poor choices for kids|1
Nice collection, latest trends, affordable pricing..gr8 discounts if you are lucky|1
Good sales! I bought some really nice trousers for 20 pounds|1
Fair enough prize for good quality|1
They don't have a Home section or a very big sportswear section.|1
Great for picking up essentials and everyday clothes and accessories for men and women|1
Love this shop nice variety of clothes for children's and adults|1
Clean, lots of lovely things ! Well spread out, fab|1
Pretty clean. Not a good range of clothes|1
i like hm. a bit of everything to suits different sex and ages but limited kids stock|1
Partner and I went into 2 other H&M stores for a particular item and was told that item was no-longer in stock in any of the stores. Was even told by a staff in this store on the ground floor that it maybe out of stock but it would be on the 2nd floor if they had any left. Asked a really friendly Italian gent. Who not only knew what she wanted but where. Back on the ground floor near where the other staff member had been working. So thank you to him and your 4 is yours alone. Should have been 5 but your colleagues let you down.|1
Great place with amazing collections.|1
Nice and spacious, not too crowded.|1
H&M have decent clothing for men and women. Pricing is good.|1
Good quality products, trendy clothing.|1

4 floors of the well-known economic brand. Amazing prices for acceptable quality. Prices shown in pounds sterling and euros with an aligned conversion rate|1
Quite a large H&M store, a particularly large selection of clothes for women.|1
Big row..|1
A large h&m with everything you would expect from an h&m store. There are several here in this area so if you don't find the size you want in this one, continue on the same street and you will find another one.|1
Great for shopping during Christmas with cozy Christmas music. Plenty of choice and affordable for everyone!|1
Like all the same h & m stores I never come a 1st day of sales in London moreover it is not very interesting we find the same in France|1
A very large store with varied prices but which does not have a very large selection for men.|1
Store that follows the well-known H&M trend. Competitive pricing and frequent item renewal.|1
Shopping failed today, if Under Boop failed|1
Great prices. Includes a children's department and is very close to rehabilitation.|1
Muy buenos precios. Ropa muy variada.  Very good prices. Very varied clothing.|1

This is a rare H&m houseware store in Japan.|1
Huge H&M with a large selection. So if you haven't had enough of H&M in DK, you can easily buy cheap clothes of Nordic quality.|1
I shopped in the Regent Street H&M Home last night. I was a bit lost with where to find certain items I had seen online. I asked a sales associate for some help. I was looking for a certain candle which was not found in store. However, Rachel advised me that she would go downstairs and check the Stockroom to try and find these for me. as she was heading off the sales floor, another lady I believe to be the manager in charge asked where was she was going, Rachel replied “to find some candles for this gentlemen, the Green dinner candles” of which the manager in my opinion wasn’t best pleased she was leaving the floor and simply said  “erm may be” (kind of eye rolling) Anyway, Rachel found my products which were sold out online and not available on the shop-floor she gave me two of them as I requested which made me very happy. Rachel also helped me to find several other items within the store that I wasn’t able to. Rachel also served me at the till point making sure I knew about my H&M app and even showed me where I could save £3 in vouchers that I didn’t know I had towards my sale. Honestly, it’s not mentioned enough when you get a good service in stores people tend to just focus on the negative. Rachel is a credit to that store and had she not of been there I would’ve walked out empty-handed. She is a breath of fresh air in a very busy retail environment but she made time for me and made me feel I was a valued customer and friend. Well done Rachel!! I’ll be back that’s for sure!!|1
Flagship store so it looked great.  Large screens playing some cool effects.  Store was tidy and well kept despite the heavy traffic.  There was a lego rep for Xmas handing out free lego and a small station for kids to make little bits.  Overall a great experience at the store. Thanks.|1
Pal is an amazing stylist and has great attention to detail. My experience was enhanced mostly because of the care with which all the options were presented to me. Amazing concept by H&M!|1
We really enjoyed our visit to H&M Home... we found amazing stuff wich will fit great our kitchen... so excited Well done 😊😊😊 …|1
This H & M have can buy baby clothes Location in London Oxford Street opposites of apple Store. Very good to shopping.|1
A new experience .. you can now rent your evening dress and the prices are crazy low . . Check it out such a cool experience|1
I love the displays but they were little short of men's winter clothing|1
Nice collections at a great location as usual clothing at h and m is of good quality. Huge shop with a lot of space and great ambience for a cloth store.|1
Kids floor is excellent, welcoming and interactive ♥️|1
H&M is a amazing clothing shop, my daughter worked as shop assistant here for many years during the school time, and she had some massive discount! They have very decent quality stuff (better than Primark) and at a just slightly more expensive prices. If you never visit this Swedish multinational, you should!!|1
The staff in kids area is so kindle|1
This H&M isn't huge but it's a decent size... considering there is another 3 H&M stores within a few minutes of this one. There's a reason why H&M is so successful and this store is a testament of their success. Great staff, great products and even though I went in to get something small I didn't have to wait long in the queue. Brilliant!|1
I will be brief, I know what it is to work with the public and more in a store like H&M, and the other day I was amazed at the treatment of a portuguese girl, she was blonde, about 30-40 years old, she attended me with a sweetness and delicacy that reminded me why I work in what I work, I go many times, and I don't have a single complaint (maybe in the oxford circus if I would), but here I just say that all of you are wonderful, thank you portuguese girl, you are great.|1
Many beautiful things, with a good price and Natasha was super helpful in the fitting room. Definitely the best H&M customer service in London.|1
Itself, the store is very well merchandised and stocked. Staff as well, have always been very friendly, approachable and helpful, without being pushy. Particular shout-out to Steven (Stephen?) who helped me with reserving many cushions over at the Shepherd's Bush store. Dream team!|1
thanks for the good and polite communication with customers, the attitude is at the highest level, the quality is good, the choice is wide|1
This has become my favourite home, decor and interior store. It's also got a lovely cafe you can get pastries, hot pasta and sandwiches,  beverages and more. Love the florist in corner of the store.|1
Very beautiful interior decor with a very attractive display of items. Roaming is easy inside. Prices are very fair and affordable. Staff are a few however so expect searching for one when you need help. It is very clean and well taken care of.|1
This shop is observing social distancing beautifully. This allowed me to feel safe whilst shopping here. The store is located on Regents Street and has just reopened to the public.  I have often walked passed this site and could not wait until they opened so I could browse around the store and see the home furnishings they sold.  Wow, this shop is like walking into an Aladdin's cave of home furnishings. Once it draws you in you found yourself being wowed by the imaginative and beautiful way they display their goods. At times I felt I was walking into a royal kitchen (almost expecting a butler is be coming around the corner to ask what we are doing in this part of the house).  The store is over two floors and sells artistic but practical home items for most rooms around the house at astonishingly competitive prices.  I recommend this store for people who want to give their house of flat a tasteful but original touch. Out of you want to buy that special gift.|1
H&M is gradually becoming my favourite place for shopping. I know it's a chain, but I love it anyway. Their coats and jackets are great, as well as the skirts and even the swimwear. Nice location, clean store, friendly and helpful staff.|1
I am so in love with H&M Home. Wonderful ideas to help you turn your home into somewhere stylish and special. Without it looking like an 'IKEA' home - if you get my meaning. Going back again soon.|1
One of my Favourite stores you can sort the whole family out in one place at a really great price ....  Like the outfits like the one I'm wearing... @h&m|1
The staff were great. They answered all of my questions and offered suggestions for things I couldn't find. The queues can be a little long, but they do go quickly. This is a very busy part of London so it's not surprising that this store and those surrounding it would be busy quite often.|1
Lovely and spacious store where you find what you need at good prices.|1
International brand name store selling cloths especially for young people.|1
Late evening. Not so overcrowded|1
Very polite staff and good choice of merchandise|1
I've just received some amazing customer service from Ruby and wanted to share - thank you! Very happy customer 😊 …|1
H&M store is next to Piccadilly Circus underground station. The store is divided into different sections. The basement consists of men clothing. The ground floor and upper floors has women and children clothing. You can find latest trendy as well as formal dresses here, including shirts, t-shirts, trousers, coats, jackets, tops, jeans and party wears. The staff is user friendly. You can also use one4all gift card. The store also has its own card.|1
Cool store! Lots of floors to buy your products - but only a small portion of mens clothes. Escalators were a little confusing on the top floor (noticed a lot of people were going the wrong way)|1
I find this to be a really good branch of H&M with its recent launch of H&M studio line in store. A good selection of the more trend lead pieces can be found here, as well as accessories, shoes, kids and men's. No homeware here, there is a section in the store on Oxford street which has the homeware.|1
I went today to H&M regent street I was served by the guy called DAREEN I want to express his excellent customer service I’ve had with him he’s absolutely amazing worker thank you so much Dareen and hope to meet people just like you 👌👌 …|1
Wow what a big h & m. So many floors and so much to see, I was very impressed. Well organised and covid secure.|1
Always find something I like at this store. Super big with lots to choose from. Lovely organic cotton basics too. Often have great scarves too (can be used as hijabs)|1
I love this place as the clothes are quality and you can wash them over and over again without colour faded or shrinking|1
Nice linen blend casual wear pants and best price 😘😘😘 …|1
You can often find those sold out one offs here. Worth a look.|1
There was really good stuff and our family loved it, it had many stuff on sale that were very cheap and useful.We spend 3 hours looking around and buying stuff!|1
Good selection of high quality clothes and great prices. Good for kids wear too.|1
Found an outfit for my daughter's Halloween party but a few hours of walking I wanted to stop but your store was last on my list I was determined to get an outfit that day. Thanks for that.|1
Very good! H&M always have nice products and always change|1
Great customer service|1
Not too long queue and very well maintained during this time.|1
Large, tidy, well spaced out. Feel bad for the chaps as their section is so much smaller than the ladies. Staff are mostly professional.|1
Nice store, pretty spacious. Never managed to get stuck in its rush hour so it seems pretty quiet to me. Nice product for an affordable price|1

Exceptional!!|1
I really like everything there!|1
Huge and very nice shop, with a giant screen near the escalators showing very choreographed graphic effects and attracting attention even from the street.|1
I loved these pants like loved them. I literally wore them a few times and just purchased them a month ago. But this morning when i already had my jeans on and ready to go I bent down to grab something and they ripped right by the pocket. I tried calling customer service but they said it would be difficult to do an exchange because i didn’t have any tags(but i have the receipt). So yeah I won’t be purchasing these or any of these again.|0
It’s a Sweden brand, which we boycott because their racist double standard government they let extremist burn the holy book|0
Only 2 cashiers working in the busiest time of the year. ABSURD|0
Had an unfortunate experience. Bought three pieces of boxer shorts for the price of two. One of the pieces of clothing was damaged when I opened the box, and I obviously wanted to change that pair for a new one. However I had to pay some dollars to get a new pair of shorts.|0
I bought a shirt that said it was supposed to be 12.99 but the total came to 18.04 and it said I bought 2 items but I only bought 1|0
Actually bad customer experience. Wont spend time and money here. I know customers are a lot today but that should not be not an excuse.|0
Worst experience. Never visit. Anthony the manager is so disrespectful and abusive.|0
I want to know why you have 2 floors, ample men's clothing, ample women's clothing, a section for accessories, even a housewares section. But 0 plus size options. It's really overdue for mainstream retailers to be inclusive. I don't need to try on a duvet cover, I do need to try on clothes that fit my body. I shouldn't have to explain to a global retailer in 2019 how awful it is to be having a fun shopping day with your friends on Newbury Street and need to sit out when they hit your store just because you're not the same size as your friends.|0
This store's manager is the most impolite employee I've met at H&M. He treats customers like garbage; as if he were doing a favor to them|0
Yesterday 10/21 around 11am I had a bad encounter with a sales associate/supervisor working the fitting room. I had several garments including a hat, to match an outfit I was considering in purchasing. Associate stated I was not allowed to go into the fitting room with the hat to try on, not knowing I previously worked at H&M and know the fitting room policy. So I asked him how would I be able to try on the hat with the outfit then, he stated I can go in the fitting room put on the garments I want to try on then call him and he will bring the hat, then take the hat back. Which did not make any sense. Later after I purchased the hat he didn’t allow me to try on, I informed him I previously worked at H&M and know that you are allowed to go into the fitting room to try on hats with out being monitored, I had ask to speak to a supervisor to make a complaint not knowing he was actually the supervisor on shift. Sales associates including supervisors should never profile a customer like that as you can lose sales. Yes I looked young and I am African descent doesn’t mean I plan to steal a $12.99 hat. Which everyone knows anything over $9.99 has sensors on them. He told me if I still have an issue just call customer service to make a complaint and have a nice day (sarcastically). Employees like that should be addressed and properly trained on discrimination and customer service skills.|0
You mean to tell me i can go to Braintree with less selection than a flagship location and find just what i need? Horrible service hot and not shopable. Clothes on the floor and customer service is -100. I hear the emplyees complain about how they hate it there and cant wait to leave. Obviously they need more people that loves there job. And can help me find a basic shirt without having to ask 10 different people. Gotta love low budget fashion|0
Horrible Experince! The lady at the fitting room was so awful and mean. I had over seven items and she said that I would have to try on the rest of the items later which I was completely okay with. Later I was underdressed so I politely asked if she could hand me the other items in exchnage for the items I had already tried on, she looked at me and said that I would have to come out and get them myself! I was liteally five steps away from her! Later when I stepped out to get my stuff, she asked how many items I had I said six and she would not believe me so she made me, so she counted all the items herself. I feel offended and never had such an expereince at H&M.|0
-Collection of clothes is [personally] not pleasing. -The layout of things makes it difficult to move around. -Employees could not found anywhere when their help was needed.|0
Rude staff, pathetic collection, over priced|0
While purchasing a white hoodie the cashier dragged it on the counter top so now theres blue pen marks on the back ...........|0
Inefficient stuff, the female manager is extremely unhelpful with the refund issue,  super disorganized store management|0
You should really provide a toilet for consumers.|0
Very slow customer service Store is a mess !!|0
They suppose to close at 8:00 pm on Sunday and I went to the store about 7:00 pm and the security guy told me they were already closed|0
I was seriously disrespected by a male employee. Better to just order online|0
No chairs in that place.|0
Rude staff, bad quality of clothes. Keep away|0
They always open the doors late!!|0
Stupid and disrespectful employee|0
Look for another H&M 😐 …|0
They offer horrible service. They can’t refund with Apple Pay and the guy told me to get a temporary physical card from the Apple Store. But the guy lied because Apple Store doesn’t have such service. I will never buy anything from the H&M.|0
Store manager assume costumers as liar|0
Lack of a lot of items and extremely unpleasant sellers|0
They need to hang their long coats/dresses somewhere higher…. This is gross. Buyers, beware if purchasing long items like these. Otherwise, it is a decent H&M with a large selection of items, and a great team of employees.|0
This place has a really good collection on a random day and no good collection at all on other days. Considering that this place is always crowded and billing line is always huge, they don’t have staff on the first floor for billing ok weekdays which makes it look like it is crowded all the time|0
Long wait in line even with 4 registers open. Same as Zara down the street. Be prepared to wait. The mostly Gen Z workers just move extremely slow and unmotivated. Asked for a bag, she forgot to give me one, and then bowed to me Buddhist style and got it passive aggressively. Weirdest interaction I've ever had in a store.|0
"Extremely rude and unhelpful staff working in the fitting rooms. Also, it's impossible to go there with friends to see wheather things look good on them or not because ""it's not allowed to go into the fitting rooms area"", which is weird coz it's allowed in pretty much every single HnM I've ever been to."|0
Only went in here for a few men's tees. It was so crowded you could hardly move and huge lines for the fitting rooms.  Clothing racks are over-flowing and crowd the entire store, so not much room to move through the store, so good for a quick in-out visit, but wouldn't be very relaxing to actually browse around.  Got the tee's we needed though.|0
Sure it's big, and has a great range, but the floor service was dismissive and unhelpful, and the checkout service was appallingly slow, and the girl just stuffed the clothes into a bag without even folding them. But to be honest she was much more interested in joining her colleagues in conversation about anything but what was happening in the store. H&M needs a secret shopper to kick the backsides of these lazy staff and protect the brand.|0
Chronically understaffed and extremely hot and humid. I almost passed out waiting in line to check out.|0
If you need clothes that are moderately overpriced, this is a fine choice. But generally the culture and values that they project seem to emerge from this sad combination of mindless fashion, body shaming and copratism. And one can only assume that any money you spend there will go towards advancing those unfortunate values.|0
I like this store because they have children cloth, but I had several problems here, like they left the alarm tag on several times and they didn't put all the items in the bag (that happened to me twice, once I paid for a shirt which wasn't in the bag and another time I thought I'd bought  a shirt, which wasn't in the bag when I got home... so many mistakes here!|0
It was crowded. The place was a disaster and the workers were stuck up and rude.|0
The selections are amazing but the customer service is horrible. Everyone acts as if they have something better to do than assist customers|0
So sad Mens collections are very (Gappy) So generic. Repeat repeat.  So Gap. Please bring fashion back. Forward, trends, and design.😫😫😫😫😪😪😪😪😪😪🤞🤞🤞 …|0
Never enough fitting rooms, men selection is sparse as hell|0
Associate  at check out , seem , not interested. No thank you , nothing!|0
The men’s options here is really small|0
Messy organization. Limited variety of sizes and products. Bad service|0
No real method to where things are placed..2 floors of disorganization|0
Sales associate not aware of actual discounts|0
Nice price but racist employee|0
Mediocre, expensive clothing.|0

What a mess...|0

Just heads up they don’t do price match so if you’re looking for something in store might have to go somewhere else or order online|1
Visited to see some home decors in H&M and this only has very limited options. You cannot find lots of varieties, however, what they have is really beautiful.  Can find payed parking around the building for 2 hour from Mon to Sat(Sunday is free).|1
Hnm is the main location for work clothes and business casual clothes.  However it seems like they have less and less clothes out. There's usually only 1 maybe 2 registers open so be prepared to wait. That goes for downstairs as well. They have a huge children's section but for women good luck trying to find your size. Still a great store to find clothing but its more like a needle in the haystack.  I wish they never closed the downtown location.  That location made sure to have a wide range of items and don't bother trying Cambridge location they don't have much either.|1
Just a regular h&m, a little bit messy. Nice but not enough employees, long queue.|1
I think the clothes is good, but the pants are way too long and the petite size is only available over the website. I ask this girl and notice that they do help the guests but have this kind of rude attitude. Even though I love the clothes, not too much luck for me in this occasion. COVID safety: everyone wears a face mask (staff and guests), didn't see any signs of bathroom open or antibacterial available.|1
They had a decent selection of clothes for both men and women in terms of styles and pieces but they dont have a good size range on the plus size end. The biggest size they have in shirts is 14 which, while fitting in some areas.. didn't fit in other areas (intentionally vague). Store is two story and the staff is friendly but don't always take the initiative to ask if you need help. This is not always a bad thing as sometimes you want to peruse without having to talk to anyone.|1
Clothes are alright quality for the price, some articles are more fairly priced than others, some are just awful quality. Gotta try stuff on! Overall a ton of inventory to choose from. Checkout and dressing room lines tend to be long and move slow, depends on which employees are working and what hour of day you go.|1
The store has a great selection of clothes at a high price though. The colors are not exactly unique in their range of avalibtes. Although their clothing patches are fun and cute. Their range of accesories are low to midrange at best.|1
The store had a lot of clothing to look at however the racks were really close together making it very had to move around in the store. The fitting room on the top floor had a huge line. The fitting room on the ground level had no one in it.|1
This is a fantastic location.  Much better than the dwntwn xing store.  The threads are still  young and hip but the store grew up.|1
It's hit or miss with location. The lines' current season of fashion are kind of mediocre. Cambridge Side has better sales.|1
Women's, men's, children's clothing styles. Many very good looks. Housewares too! Very surprising variety.|1
It's ok..just know what your looking for and you'll be fine.|1
I like of these stores, but this one in Boston expose the clothes with wrong prices for our surprise at the register.|1
The lighting was great, those boston prices not so much.|1
Very clean and packed clothing store. Has entrances from both Newbury and Boylston st|1
It is always difficult to find what you are looking for. Probably the fashion is limited and does not get rotated that much...|1
Good for what it is. They try to shove a little too much into the space they have though.|1
Not much customer service and the staff don't really know their stuff.|1
They seldom have enough folks working behind the registers so the lines are super long.|1
Good products considering price. Abismal customer service|1
Quality of clothing has definitely changed.|1
I've seen better stores, but it's Okey.|1
Always crowded.  But nice clothes.|1
Shopping average quality for reasonable prices|1
It's got clothes. The shelves are a mess|1
There were not too much variety...|1
Great variety|1
Lines moved a bit slow when I was there.|1
Too small of selection for men|1
Staff are pretty unfriendly.|1
Large but somewhat disorganized|1
No athletic clothes.|1
Good H&M|1
Cheap European diggs!|1
Messy and a little dirty.|1
Just another H&M|1
Helpful staff|1
Standard and standard|1
It's retail on Newbury Street.|1
The store is great but the attendants leave too much to be desired. Nothing courtesy. But it has great prices.|1
The store was messy, good price|1
Precios caros y ropa basica  Expensive prices and basic clothes|1
Disinterested staff|1
I'll find a lot of good deals on sale. There is a wide collection of merchandise including formal wear.|1
H & M has just what you need if you are into the 2000s aesthetic or need practical clothing. Although, the quality is not great. This store is great for new trends but it doesn’t last a long time.|1
Nice kid's clothes selection|1
I love the location. The prices are great.  The selection for plain Ts and the basics is all the same. But I prefer the Men’s wider selection at the H&M at the Cambridgeside Galleria.|1
The men's selection is small, but what is there is well organized and there's a good clearance section|1
I feel like the target-demographic has gotten younger based off the clothing available. There used to be more professional options in the women's section, especially, now everything seems to skew younger (teen, possibly undergrad college). I feel like the men's side is better stocked for a young professional than the women's side, which I'm disappointed about.|1
Lots of stuff my kids wanted... dressing rooms were packed!|1
Good place to buy clothes|1
This place is usually packed. Clothing is mostly in place and nicely grouped in their proper sections so it's not terribly hard to find things. What you see on the floor, as I'm told by the employees is everything they have so if you don't see your size you're generally out of luck.|1
H&M I like this store/chain. Decent clothing, good prices, usually lots of color. And a colorful place, too. Unfortunately for me, I have expanded beyond their size range. I still think you should check in..|1
A little disorganized but overall decent|1
Always love an H & M.! Can always find something that strikes my fancy and won't even scratch the surface financially. More importantly, service is good. There is never a long wait. Thanks H & M!|1
Good deals with blouses. I went in to check out their fitted blazers but they were a little oddly shaped though the suits said petite ( I'm a petite person).|1
Love the home department, just wish there was a larger selection|1
A pretty decent H&M. There are two floors, mens in the first floor and womens and kids in the second floor. The sales here are pretty subpar, and the racks tend to get pretty messy during the busy hours. Try to come early to beat the crowds, or you'll have to wait in line for at least 20 minutes to try on clothes, and then to purchase them.|1
It's a big H&M with a lot of concepts. Modern Classic, Divided, Everyday, Kids, Conscious Collection, Trend, Men's, and even Home... And they will defintely stock special collections when they come out. I'm probably missing some since I don't really shop there anymore but if you're an H&M fan, you'll love this store.|1
Even though this is a somewhat large store, the staff usually does a decent job at keeping it tidy. There are far too many racks and tables jammed into the space, so navigation can be a hassle, but the sale section can't be beat.|1
Great selection, but long checkout lines|1
I’m not a particular fan of H&M, but I do find something worthwhile from time to time. This H&M is the largest I have seen to date and has a massive selection. Definitely worth stopping in if you have the chance.|1
Love the size of the store ! It contains way more than a normal store has and it has a huge men's and home section. The only downside is the long lines at the cashier; they never seem to have enough staff available.|1
Good place to get all you need for your home and clothing|1
I like the selection they have here and the deal are great. the custmer service is ok. I wish they would be more welcoming when you enter the store or something. Its cool though|1
Great options for cute clothes! Really good prices. Certain racks are really crowded so it's hard to get clothes off of them|1
It is comfortable to do clothing 3shopping because the store is spacious and has plenty of products. But H&M HOME doesn't has much products.|1
It's small for an H&M and the selection isn't that great but it's still a good store and they have some amazing deals from time to time.|1
One of the bigger H&M stores.|1
Large selection of clothes. Mens in the first floor and womens and H&M home on the 2nd floor. Surprised to find that there is a H&M home section.|1
Great clothes but busy lines! People are not social distancing on a busy Sunday afternoon there|1
This is a huge store and usually in decent shape. (Far better than the downtown location) The Home and Men collection both worth a visit.|1
Some good 100% cotton quality tops and I like their recycling old clothes to get discount program|1
Great selection of essentials, good if you need a quick closet update or you want a trendy piece for a cheap price.|1
Cheap and best.. good clothing options.. collection of formal wear although not so great!|1
Awesome store! Can find fast fashion pieces at a good price.|1
Somewhat clean and very claustrophobic. Well organized store. Friendly employees. Great service.|1
Great clothes, great prices, excellent location. However, not very well organized|1
Good selection and great location|1
Two stories gives room for a lot of clothing options. And they have home goods at this store as well.|1
Nice branch. a big selection and it has a home department which is nice. Good location as well.|1
Good selection but it's over picked so you won't find much late in the season.|1
Affordable European style. The store is usually organized so is easy to find what you are looking for!|1
Newly renovated two floor store. Always packed so be prepared to wait in line.|1
Smaller than normal store, but very helpful staff|1
Nice store, clothes were reasonably priced|1
Has amazing collection. Sales are must visit.|1
Staff is quite rude .... Cambridgeside h&m staff is far more helpful and courteous.|1
Good basics! Also love the accessories. Nice salespeople.|1
Great place to pick up socks underwear a cool sweater|1
Large store with multiple levels. Very clean, no bathrooms for public although.|1
Decent deals and a full room of H&M Men selections!|1
Good location for H&M in Boston. One of the largest in town and with good selection|1
Good selection, update collections. Although weekends can be messy .|1
Flagship store,  friendly staff,  large selection for great prices.|1
Standard H&M store, big selection plus H&M Home line.|1
You can bring clothes there or fabric and get a 15% discount.|1
Great selection of women's clothing.|1
The only average shop in this street, well equipped.|1
You can find great sales here!|1
Love the clothes, good price!|1
Good location. Decent clothes|1
Unlogic placement of goods, but if  you have more time you can find there something for you|1
Large H&M with good collection and friendly staff.|1
They have something for everyone. Inexpensive.|1
This store has H&M kids and H&M home as well.|1
Good stuff, good price!|1

Swedish chain that offers good prices and good quality. A thousand times H&M at any Forever 21. I bought underwear and socks there for the next 10 years.|1
Lugar bien ubicado y grande. No me convenció la mercadería. Los saldos eran Espantosos y no había la calidad que tiene esta cadena en Europa  Well located and big place. I was not convinced by the merchandise. The balances were appalling and there was not the quality that this chain has in Europe|1
Big HM, you can always find something. Too bad the fitting rooms are still closed.|1
Encuentras ropa para todo tipo de reunion los precios bastantes accesibles buena ubicacion trato adecuado.  You find clothes for all kinds of meetings, the prices are quite affordable, a good location, adequate treatment.|1
Centrally located in Boston in a beautiful building with plenty of clothes and helpful staff.|1

Stylish items for affordable pricing. Repeat customer.|1
Always like this location, it's perfect spot, staff always nice and helpful|1
Very clean, beautiful. The 2022 collection there now is very clean lines and focused on shades of grays, beige, black|1
I wish I visited H&M more often. Pretty nice collection. I recommend buying tshirts from here, but not jeans or shoes.|1
Fairly affordable clothing that keeps up with style and quality. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The store keeps up a sustainable mindset as well, often giving out discounts for staying sustainable. The layout of the store is fairly open and well organized, making for an easy way to find the clothing that you need.|1
I'm not much of a shopper, but I like this store. Nice, casually fashionable stuff at a good price.  A great selection of children's clothing on the second floor.|1
Really good time. Loved the two girlies in the front. Caught an employee lackin'. Copped some really good clothes. 5/5|1
Very large selection of hm clothing, I've never seen so many clothes at one store, I didn't even know they had an hm home section.|1
I love this location because they always have a lot of variety and the store is kept in pristine condition being in a downtown location. I can find dressy clothes, business clothes, casual stuff, accessories, and even bikinis here. This is my favorite HM to visit around Boston where I live so it must be the best!|1
I mean, let's just say my entire wardrobe is from H&M. I go shopping here seasonally dressed like I own the place, and I have customers approach me for help thinking I work there. Fortunately, I'm knowledgeable on styles and colors currently on trend at the different locations. Excellent staff. Professional service and simply great sty!  [Excellent men collection.]|1
Downtown Boston. Very nice store. Clothing for the younger generation.|1
This is a great place to get needed clothing for cheap. In October, I needed to get a pair of black shorts for work. It was hot outside and the Fall clothing was in season.  However, they still had some inventory for the Summer left, and it was convenient that I didn't have to sweat my tomatoes off wearing black pants on a hot and humid day.  While there, it was nice to see that they give discounts for returning used clothing back to them in an effort to recycle. The impact that this has on our environment and the effort that H & M takes to give this opportunity makes me more cognizant of buying their stuff.  I will say, it tends to look fashionable, not Derelict-y enough but there is always a slight consideration to buy their stuff. The recycling they offer and the discount because of bringing in their used clothing is important in my consideration.  Always clean and friendly, expect a greeter at the door and at least a few people in front of you at the register, but you will get out fast enough, its fast fashion, after all!|1
"This was a whirlwind of a shopping trip.  I went shopping the Sunday of the black friday weekend found three pairs of pants, a shirt and a cardigan. When I went to be rung up, they told me that if I brought in a bag of clothes to donate they would take an extra 15% off.  It just so happened that I had a bag of clothes to donate back in my car in Cambridge.  The cashier offered to hold my items while I got my clothes to donate.  Before leaving I asked the cashier what time they closed and she replied ""9 or 10. I don't remember"". So I went home, did some errands, ate dinner and grabbed the bag of clothes. At this point it was 7:40.  When I looked up driving directions back to the store, I saw that the cashier was mistaken and the store closes at 8 PM on Sundays.  After quickly driving over to back bay and I arrived at the store at 8:00 PM on the dot. The cashier who told me they closed at 9 or 10 was actually at the door and was initially not going to let me in.  She then remembered me and said she'd talk to her manager. Her manager, Kingston, was amazing. He came over, let me in, took me to the register, called over his coworker Jade to help me and gave me 15% off for my clothes donation.  Jade was also quite pleasant and helpful.  Kingston and Jade, you were absolutely wonderful and turned the whole experience around for me.  Cashier who's name I did not catch, everybody makes mistakes. Thanks for helping me."|1
I enjoy shopping in this store. Friendly and warm staff, lots of options, a very organised store despite heavy traffic. I enjoy shopping here! A must visit for casual wear!|1
most comfortable pants in khaki on sale for $15. I also got a navy knit dress that will look good when I lose some weight around my inner tube. I also like some of the bags. I will now be taken more serious by other people for wearing these pants and the khaki top. I bought a green jacket here for $10 a thick jacket to wear in winter in dark green satin|1
"Great selection! Friendly staff! Awesome Location! I couldn't of asked for anything more! I've been to some H & M stores where you can't help but wonder.. ""why do I even bother to shop here?""... bc the customer service is sooo BAD. But this (Thank God) was not the case! One of the best shopping experiences I've had at H& M thus far and I'm happy to say I will be coming back!"|1
I love H&M they are amazing when it comes to trends and fast fashion. The only thing that continues to concern me is the ethics of the business. Are workers around the world provided a safe work environment and a living wage?|1
Good quality at reasonable rate.|1
Tremendous sale going right now! Love it there cause they try to keep things organized and clean all the time! They do such a great job!!!|1
I love it! Have different areas depending of the style that are you looking|1
Better store than other H&M.|1
Always good experience.Staff is friendly and helpful.Store is clean and organized.Only draw back is every time I shop Small sizes in Easy Iron shirts and Super skinny pants and Chinos is lacking.|1
McKayla at the Newbury St store was so helpful and very friendly and welcoming helping us checkout. We definitely be back to this store!|1
H&M, it’s awesome. Always down to buy inexpensive clothes that are pretty stylish.  Good experience at this location. Would recommend. Stay classy.|1
Better than a lot of H&M I have seen in MA. Have useful stuff. Located in a great hanging out spot. Lot of other shopping places and nice food spots.|1
Mid quality very affordable cloathes for young and children. So sportif appearance must visit everyseason for daily cloathes|1
I love that this H&M store is located in a convenient place in the Back Bay. I also love that their clothing is affordable. I also love that their jewelry is extremely affordable. I really, really, really LOVE H&M.|1
Great store, good location and I can always find my sizes 👗 …|1
Great place to shop.... Amazing deals.... Lots of options and variety of items.... Specially their collection of items for petites really helps as many other stores are always out of xs items!|1
Very Big 2 floors Wow beautiful experience and clean dressing rooms.|1
Really great selection, friendly staff. Everything you'd expect from a clothing store.|1
It's big. Quality is good. Nice staff.|1
If you are shopping for baby clothes, this is the place for you. Quality organic cotton, adorable prints for boys and girls.|1
Great store, really great prices. It somehow feels like an upscale store in the middle of Manhattan, but it's here in beautiful Boston.|1
Good range of clothing at affordable prices. Great staff, very friendly and helpful.|1
it's good place for shopping not very expensive neither cheap but neat n clean.|1
Large selection of babies, infants, toddlers clothing|1

Amazing selection for a decent price. 10/10 would recommend.|1
Nice place in downtown Close to restaurants|1
The home section of this H&M is why I'm giving it 5 stars... It's amazing!|1
Lots of merchandise to choose from and great location for tourists, in front of Copley Square.|1
My wife thinks I look great in their clothes, I think so too|1
Its large and spacious. It has everything and excellent selections|1

I would not shop here. The commercial has the MOST Horrific looking outfits and the black haired women is so hard to look at...for goodness sakes please  do something with those  eyebrows. Just poor fashion and taste all around.|0
I came to H&M Lakeland and it was the worst experience. The fitting rooms close 40 minutes before the clothing store closes. The customer service was terrible. And the teens that work there don’t have any customer service skills and have a terrible attitude. I came with my mom from out of the country and It was a Horrendous experience.|0
Basically, the mall is 2 steps away from closing. Nothing in it is worth anything. And unless you want Chinese food, there's not much to choose from to eat. There is now 5 Chinese fast food places in the food court, and that's about it. Go to Brandon, Tampa or Orlando. This place sucks.|0
This is my experience after trying to get in contact with the mall manager over several phone calls, none of which were answered or returned. I have sat in the mall management office for 10 minutes now with no offers for assistance. One of the employees looked at me through his door, then looked down and dramatically exhaled, clearly showing contempt for their customers. He closed the door, and I could hear what sounded like it couldn't be anything but a belt being fumbled with, and then a zipper. Some unnamed representative finally came up to speak with me, and she told me that performing permits aren't distributed, despite a security officer having told me they can be. I am not just fighting for myself, I want to get a shade put up over the bus benches so other people and I won't have to suffer, baking in the insane heat that Florida is famous for.|0
I'm a fan of the FYE store and finally went around the entire mall recently with my service dog and my mum. The Dillard's is like something out of an early CSI (original) episode, kinda creepy, mysterious stains, and smells like dead something. The staff I encountered throughout the mall were really friendly and had great service dog etiquette. I was shocked to learn that they pretty much just let any dog inside because the owners didn't educate them about service dog laws (did a quick run down with a security guard and Claire's employee, misbehaving dogs, SD or not, can be asked to leave). After we grabbed a quick lunch at the food court, I was disgusted to spot my service dog investigating a bunch of bugs crawling across the floor. After that, we promptly left. I doubt we'll return. The staff we met were nice, polite, and helpful, but bugs around food is not okay.|0
I purchased a bathing suit in Miami and tried to return it since I didn't use it but no one informed me of he no bottom return until I went to return it in Lakeland.  I just want to know why the hell would you return the top not the bottom that's a stupid policy.  People try on them bathing suits in the store but you all won't return them.  I will not purchase from here anymore due to that stupid policy and because when I purchased the bathing suit the policy should have been told to me and I wouldn't have purchased it I would have went elsewhere.  Never again.  Make sure this policy is told to your customers because I wouldn't have know until I purchased the bathing suit since the policy isn't posted up in the store but only on the back of the receipt.|0
(2019)  The locator thingy is in the wrong spot. Size wise it would be ideal for H & M to take over the Sears spot since Sears is finally closed but otherwise I'm leaving this a 4 star until it's moved to the exact location on this map. After that, I'll take my comment & rating down.  (NOTE: My rating doesn't reflect the store & employees so please check them out.) ________________________________________ (2020)  .... OK. I'm guessing the store owner must not had posted the location of the H&M cursor because my comment is a year old and it's still located on the wrong side of the map. Nothing has came to where the cursor is currently at and H&M is located near J.C.Penney.|0
Extremely rude and loud employees, below average clothes that fit a minimal amount of people, and cheap and rough fabrics. the only good thing is the jeans but i’d say to order the online because the experience in stores are just awful|0
I tried the store because it said it had  plus sizes now but they're plus sizes are nowhere near plus sizes. It's for the younger possibly chunkier junior plus not women|0
To start this off I would like to say I am a black man raising a beautiful young black boy. Growing up i was called monkey not because I was active but because the racial undertone of what it represent. I can give a short history lesson on how African Americans had to prove that we were actual humans and we were perceived to be equivalents to monkeys. They even put children in a zoo in cages throwing bananas at them,spitting, and throwing rocks at them while spitting racial slurs. For a company that big who has people  to research things like this should of caught this early because honestly this information and correlation isn't hard to find. So for the lack of care and respect for a specific racial demographic. This place will never get a penny from me. Not a good company for ne...|0
The store was a mess, clothes on top of racks, accessories on the ground. Waited for 15 minutes in the checkout line at such a small location. I could not believe how disorganized and sloppy this store is.|0
Nothing that would attract tourist or even locals to this mall.  Very boring.  If you are retired nice nap too sit and soak up some free air conditioning.|0
This place has gotten worse and worse over the years. The clientele does not support any sort of high end shopping and any nice stores don't last more than a year lately.|0
I used to love this location but the cashier treated me so rudely. Tell your customers that what they are buying is non refundable before you sell it to them. The cashier got so snippy with me|0
Its a mall. No security ever seen allowing punks to throw fireworks at sleeping infants. Oddly specific? You better believe it.|0
If you go there during the day or Monday through Thursday its a nice place...forget the weekend's security does not control The Adolescents.|0
Let's get some stores in there that everybody wants to go to not the handful of rednecks that still live in this town we don't need a camouflage store in the Lakeland Mall, want this mall to be flourishing and booming put stores that people go to, need a hint go  to the Brandon Mall that's where I drive.|0
Y’all better teach a certain black security guard how to talk to another man’s woman before he loses some teeth.|0
The mall is not the same anymore.  All they have is high price stores in there. All the good stores left|0
This mall is so junky, plus it has no good variety of stores to shop at. You're better off going to Tampa or Orlando mall|0
They Never have my size so I'm going to stop going to this hm location. I might stop going period if all stores are alike|0
expect your car to get broken in, expect annoying ass teenagers, expect nasty people here. The stores suck, and they are dirty. don't bother.|0
Mall is closing many of it's shops.  Quality of the products available is very low end.|0
Place is rundown and outdated with about 50% of all the stores closed down. Terrible mall.|0
Very little inventory for men and the fitting rooms were closed|0
Went to the carnival $30 for a wristband and my Granddaughter could only go on 4 rides.|0
A place where you can wait in line and no one be at the register for more then 15 min. That will be the last time i come here|0
Could not get any help when we were at Sears. Not shopping there anymore.  They have NOTHING|0
its depressing to describe in one word. Ugliest mall ever.|0
lots of stores closing. only the food court is ok|0
Google  Maps is failing again.  I wasn't even there.    This is happening a lot lately.|0
Worst mall ever it is so hard to find stores in that mall.|0
Horrible mall, dirty and the customers there are not nice|0
This place has gone waaayyy downhill and they need to knock it down and start over.|0
If you dint buy something as soon as you see it, youll lose it.|0
Racks were so full couldn't even look at the clothes.|0
Not impressed with variety for plus size women|0
Smells like an old attic. Crappy flea market stores.|0
Shabby, only a few good stores left.|0
Was better as Burdines.  Represented florida style better|0
Just stopped for a quick look.|0
Nothing there for young folks really dead environment|0
grossest mall I've been to.|0
This USED to be a mall. Thanks, Amazon!|0

Siempre vacío. No me gusta para nadaaaa  Always empty. I don't like it at all|0
A lot of empty spaces. Poorly and sparsely placed directories. Nothing for kids to do. Stores are cool, but even they offer less selection than they use to.  Great please for senior walkers, very few customers in the way.  It's a shame. This place used to be a really cool place to shop.  Owners are doing another to prevent it's demise.|0
Great location but... Another sad example of the failing of retail stores. Macy's was shut down. Burlington is sloppy & smells unclean. Much of the outside of the mall has a look of abandonment. If I could, I'd inject some life into this area with a couple beautiful dine in restaurants, some high end retail and a facelift to beautify the outside.|0
Went to take my daughter homecoming dress shopping.  There were slim pickings for stores.  Everything in the mall is marked down for store closing.  You might be able to find a good deal.|0
It's a good mall but in most of their stores tney need to keep it more clean and orginized, I know it's  not their fault that some costumers leave a mess but it still looks bad to not tidy up the place and lately  in most of their stores there is no cashier  or employee in sight to help out.|0
There is not a good selection of stores in my opinion. There are also lots of empty spaces. I will stop in at times to visit one or two stores,  but gone are the says if spending a morning or a day shopping at this mall. The couple of stores that I visit are on one end of the mall. I can park on that end, visit the two stores, then leave. Some of the other stores that I usednto visit have moved across the street.|0
It's a bummer because this mall does have so much potential with it's location right off 98, but this just feels like a dying mall.  There is an entire wing of the mall that is vacant, and then some of the stores I just can't imagine anyone actually visiting.  I would much rather go to Lakeside or travel to one of the outlets than visit this mall near my home.|0
This mall has gone downhill over the years. It has the big chain stores that you'd expect, however all the good shops in between the big stores have abandoned and seems like a flea market with a JC Pennys and Macy's..etc.|0
Update the closing information, it closes at 8 pm.|0
Great stores, but maintenance is crappy. Only 1 soap dispenser works in ladies room, half the sinks do not have water, only 1 working hand dryer out of 3.|0
When you see how empty it is getting..... Take Note Don't scurry your customers away just so you can close on time.  How about actually staying open another hour or two so customers can finish shopping. Not everyone has banker hours and I am in line with plenty of other customers as we are being driven out of the  businesses.  I'm done spending my money where someone doesn't want my business.|0
Little to no stores, half the mall was empty, the food court was the best part. the theater is a nice touch as well, saving grace for a fading mall|0
The mall is dying. Could be a sign of the times, or mismanagement, but with the major end stores closing, the mall should be an incubator for more local businesses and updated chains.|0
I don't care for this mall at all they need new stores how many shoe stores do you need. it's like the mattress firm one every 100 feet|0
NOT ENOUGH OPTIONS 4 PLUS SIZES. SHOES WAAAAAYYYYY OUT OF RANGE!! BURLINGTON NEEDS BETTER PRIZES FOR SHOES, REALLY!!|0
A lot of empty spaces that used to be shops. Bored store employees standing around because business is so bad. This place has gone downhill fast.|0
I've visited this store multiple times since it opened and have yet to find anything my size. I'm not plus size but I'm not a size 2. Also, this store is European so add about 2 sizes to your normal size.|0
I used to love to shop here until they made most of the food Asian food and got rid of so many good stores!|0
It's unfortunate, but this mall is fading out.  Used to be a great shopping experience. Not so now.|0
Went on a Sunday looking for the Hallmark store. Parking lot was mobbed, frustrated drivers going every which way looking for parking spaces. A real circus, so we left.|0
They need to fix the A/C in Dillard's. It was musty and damp not as bad in the Inside walking area but inside the stores was bad|0
Great place to walk around and window shop. Alot of neat little stores.|0
Why isn't someone cleaning the entrances...trash, cigarette buds, overflowing garbage...and the plants can someone attend to them...and how can a person try to clean a table if you are not looking at it...made it worst...sad...|0
I never really liked the area, and there is a poor selection of stores to shop at. Also, the clientele do not support any type of high end shopping or stores.|0
The Malls has gotten so run down and dirty on the outside it make me not want to shop there. Hardly cars there ever and if there is its the employees.|0
Macy's recently closed down. The mall lighting is very dim. I only go there for Crazy 8 and the shoe stores.|0
Clothes are basic looking but overpriced. Look somewhere else that doesnt have boring clothes.|0
it was fun it just needs nicer security with a smile they look kinda mean lol|0
Dead. Dining is a joke. Stores are a joke. Constant closures and moving of stores. Meh, I suppose the 80s and 90s had to die sometime.|0
I travel for work a lot, and this is one of the worst malls I've been to. The layout is strange, not very clean.|0
Only have clothes that will fit a skinny teenager...anyone over size 36 waist is screwed|0
This store is too crowded and discombobulated to find anything, it makes my OCD go into overdrive.|0
Loud music. No plus size or business wear. Nice staff.|0
Feels kind of dirty and unkept, amount of store options are not great.|0
Went to JcPenney. They employees were a little rude. Ended up putting stuff back up and walking out.|0
This mall is on life support. No real great stores.|0
Very crowded but you find cute stuff here|0
One dead mall.  Macy's just closed there and it doesn't look like the rest is far behind|0
Outside not well kept / clean Inside dirty Water marks on ceiling Too many closed store fronts|0
Those mall is dying.  Macys closed down here.|0
Not a big selection of name brand stores.|0
One of the worst malls I've ever been too|0
Not much going on in this mall. It needs an upgrade.|0
Compared to all the malls in the bay area, this one is down there on the bottom of the list.|0
Store brand names keep closing and being replaced with small stand up shops.|0
Looks like it is closing. Very few stores anymore.|0
When are the owners gonna just take the tax break and shut this poor place down?|0
Nice facility but very empty.|0
Clothes are not in plus size and they are a little expensive|0
Too small, hardly any room to walk|0
Came here for Christmas shopping, it's so dead and no shops for guys|0
Not very clean.  Shady people walking around.|0
Meh. Not a huge selection. Rather go to Orlando.|0
Pretty much dead. not much of a mall|0
Very old style. Needs remodeling bad!|0
Its old lots of shops leaving the mall|0
it sure has changed over the years|0
Small mall but okay|0
Too many stores leaving.|0
The worse customer service ever|0
Lakeland needs an upgraded mall.|0
It's ok|0
Clean your play area...|0

Cada dos semanas voy al mall y lo q no me agrada es que los alrededores estan sucios basura donde quiera en la entrada del mall  necesitan tener una mejor apariencia  tienen buenas tiendas y por dentro del mall se ve muy bien al igual la comida solo es ese detalle de limpieza  Every two weeks I go to the mall and what I don't like is that the surroundings are dirty garbage everywhere at the entrance of the mall they need to have a better appearance they have good stores and inside the mall it looks very good as well as the food is just that cleaning detail|0
Like most malls, Lakeland Square is suffering from the lack of interest in brick and mortar shopping.  Macy's is of about middling quality.|1
I was looking for skirts and was disappointed they had almost nothing. The skirts they did have were like a wool material, hello this is Florida too hot to wear that. Also the quality of shoes was horrible and way overpriced.|1
So many stores that were high quality have closed in this mall. Macy's is on its way out, and there are cheap shops like Nova that sell Chinese knock-off goods that might last a whole week. Save your money and go to a better mall. This one is good for Dillard's, and that's about it. Oh, and the food court does have some decent food.|1
I used to love coming here when I was a teen but now it seems so weird and empty. There are more kiosks now than there were in past years but the larger stores have left. There are several empty stores and the mall isn't very busy. I believe they have made a lot of improvements in attempt to increase visitors, but I'm not sure it's enough.|1
The lighting is too much, you feel like you are frying in there! They have good clothes offers but the last time I went I had to rush because I think the air conditioner wasn’t working|1
This mall used to be full all the time but now its more or less a ghost town. While I did easily find what I was looking for here at Victoria's Secret there isn't much else left. I guess all the malls in America have more or less gone the way of the dodo.|1
The mall feels very repetitive. Almost every store is similar to the other one next to it and the Theater is overpriced and has no arcade. The overall experience is pleasing if you're looking to just roam the mall but there wont be much to find.|1
For a while, this mall felt a bit run down. Recently, they have been trying to revitalize and refurbish things. There are still too many places to buy cell phone accessories, but it's getting better.|1
This mall is okay, I guess. Every time I go I try to get in and get out as soon as possible. The last time I went I saw a guy get tasered like 3 feet away from me. If you can go to any other mall I would recommend that you do, but if this is the only place close to you its not too bad they can definitely improve.|1
Wow this mall has really gone down hill. There are so many closed stores. So I go to find Spencer's Gifts they had moved closer to the food court because the end of the mall they were at is now a ghost town. This is just a sign of the times it won't be long until they bulldoze this place to put in homes|1
Large indoor mall. Excellent for walking exercise. Has Sear's, Penny's, Burlington, and Dillard's as anchor stores. Has multiscreen movie theater but no inside mall entrance.Has decent food court but no sit down restaurant in the mall. Several restaurants outside on the road surrounding the mall. Mall is thirty years old but is in good condition.|1
There is a nice selection of anchor stores, but the smaller stores change way too often. The food court has a good enough selection.  I just wish the map on Google was better and kept up to date.|1
Nice Small Mall, my little one wanted to go on the trampolines, the guy working there obviously hated his job, didn’t speak to the kids or adults just mumbled and pointed, then spent his whole time on his phone while the children were jumping. Food court was clean and a nice choice of food.|1
It's fine but they have security that likes to get slick with. You. For example me and my brother road our skateboard there. They are. Allowed. Security trys to take it because she doesn't like skateboards.|1
This mall used to be a very big deal when I was younger but it seems to be slowly dying. It's not as nice as it used to be, alot of stores are going out of business leaving empty spaces, not as clean. But it is a mall and still has decent stores available.|1
Most of the good anchor stores have pulled out of this mall with JC Penny one of the few remaining. They built a nice theater a while back but the south side of the city is where the money is so LSM is just not the place to shop any more.|1
The clientele here are fuggin garbage. There are some decent stores and a really nice theater. I recommend avoiding most stores if you can though. Unless you have a license to carry. Then you're good|1
"Over the years this mall has had a hard time keeping stores open here. We go when its a quick spur of the moment trip but when we're seeking an actual mall we unfortunately have to go elsewhere. Most of the more popular stores have moved around and taken up more of the spaces to make it seem ""fuller"" than it actually is. The food court options are pretty bleak. You have pizza, chinese, chik fila (if its not sunday) or more chinese."|1
Staff was great. I loved miss ann shes amazing. Freindly house keeper. Did everything i asked for everyday without hesitation. My husband is a truck driver and miss sara the manager allowed me to stay as lomg as i need until his trianer got there. Pet freindly hotle but gotta tell u. Rooms didnt smell like pets. We didnt hear and pets the whole 2weeks we were there. Prices are good. And the restaurant s are just a walk away. And 5 min from harrys new orleans style resturante. Omg you habe to try it. Anyhow hotle is between tampa and orlando. Safe neighborhood and respectful ppl in the area.|1
Needs more stores. Dead mall at one end. But food court actually had good food. Mall was clean but I personally would like more decorations during the holidays. Kinda blah.|1
Not a huge variety of stores and there are better malls if you drive a little farther (Orlando). Food court is great but lacks many great stores. Not crowded so if you are looking for a mall with few stores and a small crowd, this is for you.|1
Went in through Burlington coat factory.  Didn't like that there are no handicap doors. Overall mall is quiet and slow not too many options to shop.|1
The mall is getting more stores again and nicer than it was for a while! Hopefully it will keep going in the right direction! Love all the food options.|1
Pros: Good variety of stores, family friendly, the movie theater is super nice and cheap Cons: People smoking right outside the entrance or vaping inside, needs healthier options in the food court|1
Everything is overpriced in mostly every store but I like to look around anyway I like the game attic store which has old school Nintendo video games and original Xbox video games I'm mad that they got rid of the pet store because i would always go in there everytime.I really wish it was a two story mall that has escalators so it could have a lot more stores that would be cool|1
A nice place for an air conditioned stroll around convenient shops and a tasty collection of fast food eateries in the food court. Best bourbon chicken in town at the Perry’s BBQ.|1
Decent mall but much like all others it's slowly dying. Could definitely be cleaner, but you can't expect much from a place on the decline. They still have a decent collection of stores though.|1
A decent mall, but it is diminishing in the number of stores. The economy of the 1980's and 1990's has long since left Lakeland Square Mall in reminiscence of a time before the Internet. I will miss this place when it is gone.|1
Godd mall over all,  they need to take care of the entrance. You can have the best mall in side but if the building don't looks atractive from out side people don't gonna go to often.|1
The mall has gone downhill since the departure of several anchor stores. Penny's and Dillards are still there and remain the last of the big box clothing retailers in Lakeland. Sad knowing that Sears is on their way out along with Toys RUs.|1
The mall has improved a lot it is still quiet during the week (which i love) and more stores have opened, increasing the variety|1
This mall is nice but could use some remodeling inside along with an updated food court. but over all not bad|1
The restrooms needed serious help. There where a lot of variety of stores to choose from and friendly store workers. The parking needed work. They needed more security outside.|1
"Once the main mall in the area, it is now run down and lacking many major ""mall stores"". They are trying to resurrect, and are attracting some new stores so hopefully it will return to its former glory."|1
Never too crowded just wish there was more stores and things to do there..expand up make it worth doing a whole day of shopping.|1
Mostly i just visited the game shop there, they even have 1 copy of my favorite Saturn game! Hint: its $460😁 Great game shop. …|1
For shopping its great, just dont go try to get your nails and eyebrows done as a walk in they will give you a run around. Not worth it go elsewhere|1
Small mall with a single story of stores, but covers the major expectations of a mall. Bath & Bodyworks, Dillards, FYE, Cinderella Bridal, The Ink Spot (Tattoo shop), Spencer's, Comics and Hobbies, and more.|1
Wish there was more varieties of stores and eateries inside this mall. But it serves the purpose if you want a quick shopping trip.|1
Not like it use to be. To many shoe  and jewelry stores. No restaurant anymore, only the food court. Prefer Lakeside Village over the mall.|1
This mall used to be my favorite place to shop. It's definitely seen better days but it's still a good place to do some shopping|1
Limited number of high quality stores. Anchor stores are either out of business, replaced by discount stores, or don't carry the full selection they do in other locations.|1
Did not find anything that was my style can't say the same for others try it for yourself|1
Great mall lots of stores.  just wish they stopped closing so many. I seriously recommend perry's in the food court.|1
The mall still need more selective stores to shop from.  Macy's will soon be done, can't wait to see what store will replace them.|1
This mall has a decent number of popular stores and is clean. It seemed a bit dark inside. The lighting could use a boost.|1
Okay for a quick trip to JCP.  Mall is in need of major renovation.  Doesn't appear safe, especially at night.|1
Organized and clean. They don't carry plus size. Pretty things for young people. A little $$|1
It's an OK mall to go and get something quick but it could use more stores and expand to a second floor.|1
Has a lot of good stores and deals. But there is also a lot of theft and I don't care for the food court options|1
Some stores make the mall look run down.. Like it might be closing. I doesn't help that Macy's is now relocating.|1
Good to see in the day and time of online shopping you still have a great option of shopping in person.|1
It's a ok mall could be better a lot of stories have closed with more to come|1
The posted mall hours for sundays says 11am till 9 although the stores dont open until 12pm i wish that info was more clear|1
It's ok, standard Mall, has been improved a lot recently with a H&M coming soon.|1
It's a great place, just minimal stores and not much there|1
Mall is clean, but activity is very low. I was hoping to find better sales at anchor stores.|1
Older mall. Still decent. A place to go if you just want to kill time.|1
This is a great little mall, as far as malls can go.  Not a very crowded mall.`|1
I rated this a 3 star because it is basically plain and boring. I don't like much except Chick fil A.|1
Well it's really the only mall in Lakeland, decent selection of stores, but it's a work in progress.|1
A decent shopping place for nice fashion and eats. Has a great food court|1
I don't like the selection, but the employees are great. The sizes aren't inclusive, but what can I expect?|1
The mall itself is a little outdated with the courtyard has new stores a few that are updating the mall could be better in my opinion|1
I went to Burlington to buy my husband something for Father's Day and their big and tall shirt selection in not good.|1
Nice place to shop. I think we were the only people there|1
It's the only mall close and has Burlington coat factory which is a great store|1
Decent mall. Only vape shop in area open past 7pm is Vape Room in the mall|1
Nice variety of local and national stores with great food court.|1
Not a bad mall but few big and tall options|1
It's closing down a lot of stored, but it's still s good place to hang out at|1
I think this mall is on it's way out.  Stores are closing quickly.|1
I figured to come by here after years but there is barely any stores here. Kind of sad. Guess I got to stick with Florida Mall for now on.|1
Ok store if u like thier style and good prices|1
The quality of the stores is going down.  More no name stores and starting to look trashy.|1
Quality of this mall is sub par but it is a good place to kill time and randomly find stuff to buy|1
Not one of the nicer malls in central Florida.  It's pretty basic and semi-clean.|1
Very disorganized and clustered. Clothes on the floor. Store looks dirty.|1
Good place to shop but hardly any stores|1
It needs to have more updated stores. It's much to big to have such crappy stores|1
Pause emptying out there Charlie nothing there anymore I think they need to come up with a new and improve Lakeland Square|1
Macy's is gone, so it's not as great. The food court isn't my fave either.|1
This mall is pretty old and kind of rundown. Mostly just your basic mall stores in it.|1
Getting pretty run down. The great decline of the mall continues.|1
This mall just ain't the same as it used to be since so many stores have closed|1
Small and not much to look at but if you need to pick up something quick and get out is ok.|1
Nice mall, but why close at 21:00 on a Friday and Saturday?|1
Even though they are supposed to be cheap they have pretty high prices|1
Nice design but doesn't compare to Brandon or Citrus park.|1
Don't like any mall really but it's ok.|1
Mall is too small and the stores aren't that great but there is a movie theater.|1
They're plenty of stores in which to shop..Good bargains at Burlington|1
Everything is poor man prices and the shoes is durable.|1
This mall is very out dated. But has a H&M store which is a must go to.|1
Nice mall just need more stores|1
Basic mall, Macy's was going out of business...didn't find many deals at all|1
Definitely not the mall for a shopaholic, but it's worth a visit.|1
I've noticed that more stores are closed now, not sure what that means for the mall.|1
Dirty. I only go if I have to.... Or if I want Perry's BBQ LOL.|1
"Store selection is mediocre at best.  It's everything you'd expect from ""just a mall"""|1
It's okay but mall's are dinosaurs they'll be extinct doon5|1
This mall is falling apart.|1
Old mall. seems like its on the way to becoming a run down strip mall. Alot of the bigger department store have left.|1
It has great stores a little dated|1
Not to much business anymore lot's of stores closed|1
Very quite slow run down needs more stores and needs to be remodeled|1
Nice mall, But is going down hill a bit.|1
Large amount of store vacancies. Not any high end stores or large brand stores at this mall.|1
Nice clean mall that offers little.|1
It's ok but not much food selection|1
Not a lot of stores other then the normal mall stores. Most have closed!|1
Could use some more nice shops|1
Wonderful selection but the place was dead.|1
Slow decline in customers. A familiar site in malls all over the USA...|1
I still don't know what H&M stands for after going inside.|1
Don't like crowds but found what I went for  ..good deal|1
Gone down hill over the years.. parking completely sucks!|1
Most of the meat here is tough like leather.|1
It's not the Lakeland Mall I remember but it's still okay.|1
I wish there was more selection for man|1
Not quite what it used to be you got to check out the movies though|1
Lots of empty stores. Seems to be slowly turning into a flea market.|1
Mall is just OK. Not top notch. Needs updated!|1
Most stores are closed or don't care for your business|1
Great shopping for all year around|1
If you want to take a trip back to the 1980’s, this is the place to do it!|1
Nice place to get exercise on hot days|1
As malls are closing.  Not enough stories|1
Went to the movies... Saved some moved for going early.|1
Its a mall, but alot of empty spaces.|1
Nice mall just needs updates|1
Is always empty ,most stores closed down.|1
Not as great as before. Lot of empty spaces|1
Mall is small but ok for some shopping|1
Basic mall. Parking lot is always packed|1
It has stores and restaurants it's alright|1
It's a cute little mall|1
Needs some different stores to shop in|1
Not much of a selection. Just your major department stores.|1
Affordable Dentures is a great place|1
This mall is getting back to the busy mall that it us to be|1
It needs some improvement on the cleanliness.|1
Poor store services for the high prices.|1
Not many stores, need a few restaurants|1
Too expensive and not cute clothing|1
Good mall, but going down hill|1

Just to far|1
Need an express|1
Under construction|1
A standard mall.|1
Decent mall|1
Quick shopping|1
Dying mall|1
In some stores the staff could be friendlier dillards. And don't always ask if it's already finished although you still want to look. It's as if they don't want to sell. Therefore only 3 stars. The mall all in all 5 stars|1
Ok si buscas una tienda donde encuentres ropa buena y económica, está no es la tienda. Pero si hay variedad de ropa. No precisamente bonita. Sólo ropa! No es una tienda a la cual iría específicamente al centro comercial  Ok if you are looking for a store where you can find good and cheap clothes, this is not the store. But if there is a variety of clothes. Not exactly pretty. Only clothes! Not a store I would specifically go to in the mall|1
HE ESTADO AHÍ  MUY POCAS VECES, PERO NO ME GUSTA MUCHO.  I'VE BEEN THERE VERY FEW TIMES, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT.|1
Ropa. Nada del otro mundo  Clothes. Nothing special|1
Normal mall.|1
Late version of the traditional mall with strong anchor stores. Modern design with short corridors which keep the tradition mall noises down. Adequate parking and access. Wanted a cup of coffee, alas it was not to be, all food related seemed to be only in a small out of the way food court. Other malls I enjoy have various food and beverage vendor dispersed amount the corridors. Nice mall but not worth going out of your way for.|1
I like the renovations and new stores added to keep the mall relevant and a desired hangout location.|1
Good clothing and nice sales people clean store prices are are high could have been a little more organized|1
Overall it's a good experience, with most spaces filled. Dillards must not have long for this world given how run-down it has been allowed to get. Lots of choices in the food court, helping make this mall still a decent place to visit.|1
It's still a nice mall despite the some stores that shut down here. They still got most chain retailers still open at the mall. They could consider a remodel in some areas like around the food court looked the same for years not much changes here. The least busiest part of the mall is where the former macy's was and between Dillard's and Sear's section seem to have more empty storefronts. Hopefully they'll be able to maintain it in the future if not it will end up like most malls around the country that are declining.|1
Probably the last mall Polk County will see if Eagle Ridge ever finally shuts down. The mall is kept up pretty well and seems to be doing pretty well in terms of success. Would probably give five stars if it was able to fill all of the storefronts with better stores.|1
I'm not sure what is going on with this review but H&M is not Burlington, which are the pictures associated...besides that, H&M is typical. This is store is huge and clean. I wish they would carry plus size.|1
I would give it a 5 stars if there were to be a forever 21, Rue 21, and Justice, maybe a Gucci but it’s ok! And it’ll be better if the mall had better restaurants, like Subway (R.I.P) or cicis pizza, and a bigger and better place plays for the little ones will be cool too!  Love, local shopper 😌|1
Nice mall, not as busy as the Florida Mall in Orlando. Good selection of stores but looks to be in a build up of store fronts. Lots of jewelry kiosk with plated gold stuff and not a good selection of watches. Food court was nice. Wife went for pizza, me too but added a very expensive chicken grilled cheese sandwich, from some grilled cheese place. Really didn't go to shop, we wanted to get exercise and steps on or Fitbit.|1
I was shopping here while visiting family. Much busier than the local mall back home. Lots of shops. I could come here with the whole family and there would be something for everyone. Snagged some great deals at Burlington's.|1
I love the mall I just wish there was an arcade cause my friends and I always go there to hang out and we usually always do the same thing (shop and talk), but I think it would be cool if there was an arcade.|1
A very quaint little shop to browse throughout. An over anxious crowd abound however, makes for shopping quite unsettling. Perhaps it was a little too close to end of quota sessions?|1
It is a centralized  easy park,place to go.Good area typical movie house.Good popcorn and all the things  you do in-house  rather than  stream.Fun chance to see  movie when  it comes out and everyone is  talking about  it.Great family  place.|1
I gave this mall four stars mostly because American malls are dying out and this one is still hanging in there. It is also one of those malls you DONT get trapped in bc it's too big or in the middle of no where. This one has easy access in and out and is surrounded by more stand alone shopping and restaurants and near a major highway.|1
I really like this mall because it is quiet and have a good amount to offer. I wish they had more popular stores to choose from. Their food court is decent.|1
Best place to find authentic Jamaican food.(JERK CHICKEN EXPRESS) Offers big plates enough to feed two(if you get your plate made by the owner or lexi) and meals start off at 6.99 They have: Ox tail Brown stew chicken Goat and chicken  curry Jerk chicken And much more!|1
If you don't like crowds this is your place to shop especially during the week. Pretty quiet for a mall! Good stores.|1
Good selection and variety at food court. Typical mall setup and stores. Would like to see some type of attraction or promotion to bring in foot traffic.|1
Ac was broken so wasnt able to shop but just for a few moments. They had sooo much much stuff I'm definitely going back. They had everything!!!!!!!|1
It's nice to walk a round the mall, since there is always a new store either opening or closing. But it's got a lot of variety in this mall, from video games to cloths. To major stores|1
Love this mall. Wish a few stores weren't so crazy priced. But other than that, this mall has a great selection.|1
A somewhat small mall that has a good amount of shops, food, and other things to do. I haven't been there on the weekend, but during the week it's one of the least busy malls I've seen.|1
Movie theater was nice clean and some fresh popcorn for the morning show.. that was a nice feature. Typically its leftover popcorn from the night before.|1
It's always fairly peaceful and laid back during the day and more populated towards the afternoon. Can be crowded but overall not a bad place.|1
I like the verity in shops here. There is always a bunch of people of course, no different from most malls. Has one story but in the perfect location.|1
Great location, many different stores to choose from & it has a nice clean food court with lots of places to sit & eat|1
The mall is slowly getting better and adding better stores. It's very nice and always clean. Has all the usual stores.|1
The Cinemark theater is Awesome. Very different movie theater experience with the reclining leather chairs and reserved seating. Very nice movie watching experience.|1
The lakeshore mall is a fun place to go.  Watch a movie, play in the arcade, get overpriced mall food, hope your favorite stores haven't shut down yet because the man is slowly dying.|1
It is a nice mall. Good big name anchor stores. Clean. Always slow and not a lot of foot traffic inside.|1
Pretty nice mall, close to it all, easy access, great prices, wide variety, spacious and great food court options.|1
it has really nice stores and great deals. the workers there are also very polite and interact alot with the customers.|1
This is Lakelands oldest mall. It continues to update it's stores which are all very cool. It has a nice selection in its food court.|1
Nice mall but it's small compared to others I've been in.  Pretty good food court.|1
It has great food and good stores but some things are a little too pricey|1
Reasonably good selection of stores-- not as crowded as some of the glitzy malls. Good selection of food available.|1
It's a nice mall, small enough to be comfortable, but with a selection of enough cool clothes to find what you're looking for.|1
Fun usually have good or great time alot to do ,but i also do think security show act a bit nicer|1
Not bad but the stores are limited. We usually go to Westfield in Brandon but this mall is good for a quick trip.|1
Has improved quite a bit.  Turned into a pretty decent mall.  Lots of nice stores now.|1
It's nice got a good selection of stores.  It has a good food court.|1
I don't go there much, but it is a nice shopping mall.|1
Very nice mall. Shops for everyone. Not an over priced mall like some.|1
Good enough place, very small for a mall, somewhat limited food options but the Chinese food is good.|1
Great if you like the mall shopping scene has everything you need.|1
It is a nice mall. The anchor stores are good, the food court is nice, and the building is well maintained.|1
One of the best malls still alive. Food court is awesome and store variety is wonderful.|1
It's not as crowded a other malls. Wish they had more stores.|1
Great mall fun to hang with friends till you've seen every store|1
New stores have made for a better shopping experience.  Need to reopen the sit down restaurant.|1
Good places to shop, with good food. Plus they are great for Black Friday shopping|1
Large mall, clean good food court. But seriously needs better anchor stores. It was very crowded.|1
Has always been a good place. Needs some stores in though|1
Good place to shop around. Always felt safe in this Mall...|1
Nice place to shop. Great food court. JC Penney store is great.|1
Went to Chick-fil-A they're always good they always get it right the chicken sandwiches are great|1
Inventory was way down from the holidays, but i was able to get the last drill i needed!!|1
Nice mall.  Good stores. I like it. R stars room for improvement.|1
A little limited but a good place to kill some time whip you wait for the movie.|1
Outside looked like no one was there but once inside it was filled with people. Also great selection of stores.|1
Receptionist is unprofessional but the artist's are good and makes you feel very comfortable|1
It's getting better. They are adding better stores to shop at instead of the same type of spread throughout.|1
Good mall but I wish there was more of a variety of stores.|1
It's a good place to walk around and shop for the things you need|1
Love your mall I really miss JC and Sears hope that you have good plans for it|1
Clean nice assortment of stores and a good clean place for small kids to play|1
Did not think Mall would be that large.  Great selections, will be going back often.|1
Love the store.. But it's no one on the dressing room for help|1
Good selection in food court. Love that they have a Burlington here.|1
Good hang out area a lot of stores and food just toooo much money|1
Starting to get renovated. It has become a decent place to shop again|1
Nice mall.. good selection of stores and food.|1
Always something to buy or a tasty meal to be had at our local mall|1

Good choice of food places. Clean.. Great stores|1
Since they've re camped it, they have some great stores. Always tons of sales and parking.|1
Small, but nice. I liked the rental scooters shaped like animals|1
The mall has a nice food court which was very busy yesterday.|1
I liked the game kiosks in the mall. Neat place to go and hang out.|1
Well maintained. Plenty of good shops. Little crowded inside.|1
Quaint mall with the main stores within reach. Food court centrally located making it easier to manage|1
Pretty good mall. Wish it had more variety of restaurants.|1
I had to cut it short bcz u didn't know the mall close at 6 and the Torrid 's store is too small|1
A good place to meet friends, shop and work off those extra calories from the food court! 😃 …|1
There are some good stores here and the food court is okay|1
Haven't been here in a long time. Until recently. But this place seems to be busy all the time. If it is what it was when I frequented it, you can find whatever you need.|1
Big mall, I went there for a movie and to people watch, they had some interesting stores but I didn't have money so I didn't go in and avoided temptation of reckless spending.|1
Alot of good stores and kiosks to choose from and also a good food court if you get hungrey|1
This is a indoor mall with a food court just n case we get hungry while shopping. Or, for me, people watch..lol|1
Great place to go walk around and but nice clothing|1
So Many stores to choose from to shop all the latest fashion and foot wear.|1
I still don't get why there are so little stores, but they have good deals sometimes.|1
Very nice place with nice stores and people who work in them|1
Great place to shop-more stores would make it better|1
Parkings always bad but clean and alot of good stores|1
Plenty of shops to browse or make purchases. Anchors like jc penny Burlington sears dillards|1
Good place to kill time, but the bigger stores are starting to dissapear|1
The mall I go to for all clothing shopping. Rue 21 is great|1
Good assortment of shops you will most likely find what you need.|1
Good for quick shopping for things you need..|1
Like spending time in this mall, to walk or to sit in the center just enjoying the time.|1
It has all the shops and great food in one place|1
Everything you need under one roof. Great to shop here|1
You can find nice sales but not too many|1
Nice mall with a great variety of stores.|1
Need more stores,nice and friendly staff.|1
Unfortunately Macy's has closed. At holidays this can get very crowded, otherwise quiet.|1
They have recently updated the interior of the mall and they have added a few new stores.|1
Nice mall with all the good stores.|1
Good place to shop. Needs a face lift.|1
Nothing to get excited about but it's a great place to get exercise.|1

I went in this evening to do a quick exchange around 7:00pm. I asked the cashier in the womens section (brown girl I think she’s Pakistani or something. She had the accent as well) where on the floor I can find the item I was trying to exchange. She literally rolled her eyes and told me “I don’t know go ask someone working in the fitting room.” I was in a rush and didn’t have the time to discuss this with the manager, but thankfully the sweet manager or assistant manager who was by the fitting room helped me with my item. She was a lovely lady and I wish they would train their employees to have this type of customer service. That’s all.|0
The Asian woman in the fitting room staff is quite odd. I understand if two people aren’t allowed in the same fitting stall, however, what I don’t get is why she only calls out certain people and not everyone else. If more than 1 person isn’t allowed in the stall stay consistent and say that to everyone who is doing it or just shut your mouth.|0
Charging for a paper bag and not telling you. Why do big companies try and draw every cent from you.|0
Cashier was very rude and overall a disappointed experience. I hope someone can look into this and solve the problem. Here is the screenshot of the store where it happens and the information need it to see what sale representative assist me with my purchase.|0
My dinner was good. But the service and service time was horrible. Maybe short staffed? But after we sat for our reservation, other tables started arriving around us, and they got service before us.... drinks and food orders.|0
Horrible return policy. I went to exchange an item ordered online hoping to get store credit but I was told it was not possible. Employees were helpful and it’s not their fault but I do think that they should have a better return policy for online orders as it also costs $ to ship it back when most places don’t charge…|0
Took my daughter out shopping after Boxing Day.  When has it become ok to charge a customer $0.10 for a bag? Maybe coming from the suburb I feel really offended?! I spent over $200, did they think that I should carry the clothes bagless? Does H&M believe that they can recuperate enough BAG money to cover for their losses in Asia?  Eventually my daughter will out grow H&M and I certainly expect that like Gap, H&M will be a distant memory. Good luck collecting 10 cents per bag because you definitely offended this customer.|0
Management issues, suddenly you find that the fitting room is closed!! They cant blame covid this time! Who buy clothes without trying them first!!|0
Change rooms have loose curtains that leave many peep holes :(|0
The  worst customer service, very arrogant while they serving talks about there personal life, i try to talk to the manager with my problems issues but i couldn't find 1 person to listen my concern. I ll never shops in that store.|0
Very bad customer service. I have brought some clothes and security stopped me as claimed tag on the clothes did not remove. I showed her my receipt but she told me to go to cash counter agin. I went there and ask the cashier to remove the tag, she said there is no tag then I ask her to come with me to security girl or talk to ger that nothing wrong she said she can't leave that place nor talk to her. Then I asked to take the clothes and refund me as I don’t want to get bothered agin. It was very unprofessional customer service.|0
"They ran this marketing campaign saying take home to try on and return if they don't fit. Brought two pairs of pants home that didn't fit, try to return them and was told that they were ""worn"" and that ""we can't accept those for return"". Bait and switch marketing tricked me into 'buying' two pairs of pants that were too small. I had just signed up for the loyalty program as well, but now I won't ever be shopping at H&M again, which is a shame because I liked their products. But my hand is forced... would you put up with fraudulent marketing? I'll be convincing as many friends as possible of this as well, and contacting the BBB."|0
Very inconsistent return and exchange policy. I was told that I could exchange the products (socks on final sale) when I bought them. However, when I went to get them exchanged, the staff said I couldn’t. Staffs are very impolite and unhelpful. Bad experience. Would have given no stars if possible.|0
Some friends and I spent about 2 hours in this store; not a single person greeted us on the sales floor, no one acknowledged us for several minutes when we walked into the fitting room even though there were 5 people chatting in there behind the table, and a pretentious guy working took a rail and walked it between my friend and I, forcing us to move out of the way, and he didn't even say excuse me or apologize for forcing us out of his way even though he had more than enough room to go around. The girl at cash was extremely friendly though (Alexa?), almost nice enough to make up for the mediocre service from everyone else working. I expected more from a flagship H&M location.|0
"I should say customers shouldn't drop anything in the store!! One of the staff here is super rude with extremely bad attitude!! I almost felt like talking to the manager due to this experience. I see why people say that the H&M staff at Eaton Centre is horrible!! If I can give 0 star, I would....I would give the big store a 4 star, though... However, they really need to have a good team of staff working as well. Back to the experience.. First of all, I am pretty sure that the clothes were not balanced well. Just a little touch and everything fell down. I was shocked and couldn't react at that moment.. There was a nice customer who helped and at first I thought he was a staff, so I let him do his job.. then the ""real"" and rude staff come by to help and was so super rude!! Pin pointing that a customer who was standing right there dropped the clothes and still looking! I would have totally helped if there were only one staff!! But there were 3!!! Either way, that guy shouldn't treat a customer  who is right there with those rude comments. I will never come back to shop at this H&M as the respect we get here to shop is not worth spending!!!"|0
"Pathetic customer service skill by a store manager Andrea. I went to the store to redeem my birthday discount for 25%. At first she said i could only do that online, then i showed here where it clearly said i can also redeem that in store. When she was not able to scan the bar code due to some glitch on their end, instead of owning up and honoring the discount she exactly said these words ""well i don't run the app and you can come back later if u like"".not only it upset me but I was also sad to learn that People like her are running a brand like H&M"|0
Horrendous customer service. They advertise that they do curbside through Instacart yet the app itself is terrible and inaccurate. Called the store directly and was told they can work with me to buy what's in store through Instacart. I did research, made a list, called back and unfortunately got a different, terrible, lazy and obnoxious rep in the Men's department who didn't want to do a single thing to help... What else do you have to do during a shutdown? How is the messaging so inconsistent? Don't advertise curbside if you don't have it or you hire employees who would rather get paid to lie and be lazy instead of doing their actual job! Also once again...INSTACART IS TERRIBLE!|0
This place is the worst. I was just shopping for 2 hours in the store and my shopping bag was gone seconds after I left it unattended. I told it to a customer service rep. By the look on her face, seemed like she was doing a huge favour to look for it in the fitting room and a cashier. When asked for a manager - she said it was only a customer who could take a shopping bag at this point. So I have one question: then why did the stuff look for it in the places like fitting room? I just felt very unwelcome and nothing was done to help me to recollect items missing either from a rep or from a manager. If only I was there for 15 mins I wouldn’t care that much..|0
Honestly, I'm not sure how H&M survives. Really poor customer experience. $5 is charged to return on online item (very small print that I hadn't noticed before), no in-store returns, random cancellation of order when items that are in-stock then magically out-of-stock. Worst service.  Forgot about the terrible sizing, bad odour from clothing items, etc.|0
"Horrible snobby sales associate, I ran into today. Not one smile on her face. She didn't even look at me. The total was $35.90, so I gave $40.90. She grabbed the $40 out of my hand so quick the change dropped on the security tag remover and it got stuck, the whole time she was huffing and puffing and rolling her eyes. So I said "" well you shouldn't have grabbed my money out of my hand so aggressively"" she then proceeded to throw my clothes in the bag, so I snatched it from her so fast she didn't know what happened. This isn't the first time. Terrible customer service. Half of these comments are about the customer service in a negative way... it should be a clue to the establishment."|0
I haven’t went out to shop in a mall since quarantine started, so it was weird to see so many security guards which I didn’t mind. However, the moment I walked in, I saw the security guards running around as if they were chasing someone but they seemed lost. I ignored it and went on my merry way, at the time I was wearing a side tie top and it started getting loose so I found a mirror to retie it. And that’s when a security guard stood right beside me and stared at me the entire time I fixed my top. I asked if she needed something and she just ignored me and stared. I’ve never felt so uncomfortable at a mall in my life, horrible experience. Never going back|0
Mapleview mall location are Rude with costumers|0
Sell GREAT merchandise however H&M at the dufferin mall are *way to strict with return policy* must always have the receipt , even if item is new unworn with tix attached. And socks are final sale which is very odd.|0
H & M  manager (a lady on Duty) in Sherway Garden Mall  was very rude in behaving with us as well as customer. When their Associate said that if we could find new sales item  they could exchange those items (even though final sale!) as we cordially requested for the exchange . We spent time to find out items but that sales associate  gone for break so manager came to deal with us  and did not care about what their sales associate explained to us. She was very rude and disrespected us. She didn't even allow us to buy another  new items from the store since I said they were wasting our time which was absolutely right as their associate involved us to find items so she could help to exchange but manager did misbehave . If I were the main manager I could have fired her and gave her relief  because of bad customer service. She should learn how to deal with customers.|0
I had a horrible interaction around the holidays. I'm only writing about it now because I work in retail and can't stop thinking about how bad this store is. I admit I should have tried on this pant before I bought it, but the sales associate was INCREDIBLY MISLEADING. She said I could exchange the item if it didn't fit. Well, it didn't. So I went back the next day. It was a size 12... I'm a small at Roots so I don't know why I'm a 12 at H&M, but size 14 is not sold in the store (only online which is also dumb). I wanted to exchange for another style to see what fit. I talked to a meek young man, who suggested I try stuff on and he called his manager. Well after trying on 8 pairs of size 12 pants the manager tells me over the WALKIE TALKIE that I actually can't exchange my item. SHE DIDN'T EVEN SHOW HER FACE. I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN. Not only was I lied to in the first place, but the manager is obviously setting a horrible example of customer service and now I'm stuck with an OK mug and a cheese board I don't even use. Oh yeah, I went back a few days later and spoke to some slacker associate who let me exchange for a mug and a cheese board (cuz I obviously cannot buy clothes there. And never will). If you need customer service training, take a peek in this store for some examples.... Of what to avoid.|0
No privacy in change rooms.  The  staff was pleasant and it was clean and orgnized despite this I will not return.  The curtains in the changerooms are impossible to fully close.  I struggled to not look in on others changing and knew they could also see me changing.   Increadably uncomfortable and exposing.|0
I bought a coat that I paid cash for, I tried to return the coat because it did not fit me but I had lost the receipt. The staff did not give me any options to help me mend this situation. They were rude and disrespectful to me because I have an accent. I have never felt so belittled before in my life, it made me very upset.|0
"I have been trying to talk to a sales associate for 2 days now, to check in-store availability of an item. These were the least helpful associates I have ever come across, and I've worked in retail for a long time.  Not a single one of them was willing to help, but kept passing me along to another ""department"", which resulted in about 15min-20min of hold time to a destination where associates didn't pick up the call. Then I was bounced back to another phone line - where I started - where the associate put me on hold again to try and patch through the department that didn't pick up in the first place.  They didn't pick up again, so once again I was passed back to the ""main"" line where they put me on hold again and then hung up. This has happened 4 times now.  For a flagship store, this is unacceptable. Ridiculous even. You should not be this disorganized."|0
Cheaply made items. Seems to offer clothes for very thin/skinny people only. Rude staff.|0
Worst customer service EVER, made me want to never shop at H&M again! The first sales associate was rude to me and the other did the math wrong on my purchase. They really need to teach them how to treat a customer and basic math.|0
"Absolutely terrible Staff puts my items back by mistake Responds by ""I dont know where it is; its my first day""!!!!! Manager took ownership after I informed him  Would never everrrrr shop online They charge 15% tax in ontario LOL Really bad online shopping experience $4.99 restocking fee... ridiculous!!!  Lesson learned: never shop here Music is outragously loud and annoying in their stores"|0
"The worst h&m i have ever ever step foot into. If i could rate 0 stars i would. You get no help.. not even a smile... i was trying to get a pair of jeans off the highest rack with 2 employees just staring at me .. not even offering to help. Get to the cash and had to deal with this girl named ""cherrie""  classy name for a classy girl... she was so ignorant and when she refused to take my american visa ... she got so annoyed when i had CAsh. Are you serious ? Never ever ever again ."|0
Nothing I hate more than a cashier with the attitude that they are doing you a favour cashing you out.  Thank you.  You should be saying it FIRST- not me. Why are these kids so awkward and un-mannered ?|0
I never saw one employee in the store .it's like it's been run by invisible staff .|0
Misleading staff. Not cooperative Manager is not cooperating and refused me badly for exchange which was promised by the staff. I was regular customer but will never go to Dundas hnm branch because of bad behavhior and wrong dealings|0
Terrible customer service.  They make mistakes when you ask them to hold items, they don't know online promotions that can be used in-store (e.g., coupons), and they seem to lack common sense when it comes to deciding whether or not to honour prices on their website unless they get a manager involved.|0
Very rude manager. False advertising, then discarded me, for his or the store mistake, very impolitely|0
Not accepting online returns, despite their website AND return packaging stating that it is allowed.|0
I wish the changing room staff could be polite, ultra rude.|0
Used to carry a variety of sizes, now suited to only skinny People. Not cool.|0
H&M is using factories which physically abuse their (mostly female) workers - Watch footage from netflix documentary 'the True Cost' for video evidence.|0
The security guy follows coloured woman and the guy in trial room is extremely rude and super unfriendly.|0
Cashiers are slow|0
Such rude staff! Asked for another size and she walked off and said go ask someone else.|0
I went buy store closed due to Covid-19.|0
Why do they close at 9:10 pm if the business hour is 9:30 pm?|0
Shope there if you re trendy and skinny|0
Never went into store just passed by.|0
This store wins the medal for the worst customer service!|0
You should not be invading my privacy in this manner.|0
Needed a scarf,couldn't find it. COME ON MAN!|0
Loud music, bright lights, poor selection.|0
Poorly customer service|0
Awful!!|0
Bad customer service|0
Understaffed|0
Terrible service|0
no minions|0
Great selection compared to other locations. But the customer service is non existent. No greeting or even acknowledgement from staff. The fitting rooms are not private because you can see people in the reflection of the walls.|0
I frequently order and purchase things from H&M, particularly their home line. Yet, I find this location to be a bit of a mess with abrasive employees. I went in for a return and to pick up a couple things. I initially couldn’t find the item I was looking for with no employees in sight besides on cash. Then when I went to make the return (only had the return label as my package was missing the slip) the cashier was quite rude and rushing me and trying to touch the app on my phone to pull up the order QR code despite me doing so quite quickly. When it came to the purchase I was making the one item was partially missing and damaged, I had found it in the sale section without an adjusted price. When I asked what it could be discounted the cashier didn’t give me enough time to explain that additionally to one parting being missing, there were also damages. The manager didn’t even give it the time of day and offered 15% off something that half of which was missing or damaged.|0
Usually find what im looking for here but not today. Not much of a sale and im finding quality for mens casual very cheap. I found better quality at Old Navy.|0
"I was there just this weekend and got some stuff. When at the register, the guy charged me full price for an item that was on sale. So I had to go back and get that fixed and the person at the counter did not even apologise. What's worst, I go back home and check the same thing again, they forgot to take the big security tag off the cardigan, so I had to go back again the next day. I am at the counter again with my receipt and expressing my disappointment and the guy replies ""Oh well, that's too bad, isn't it"" with no hint or sign of apology.  One of the worst customer service I have ever expereinced. I am not upset because they made a mistake, what upsets me is the fact how certain retail employees talk to people. If you have work in the service industry, better have the correct manners and the right attitude.  And in saying that, I have worked in retail myself and never treated people like this."|0
So if something is shown as $14.99, it might not actually be $14.99. Rather, something else on the same rack. This is frustrating when the real price of the trouser is $29.99.|0
The Brown female manager at the Eaton center ,children's section is so rude. She is the most rude manager I ever saw in my life ,and she laughs at customers with other workers,what a horrible customer service at this place I love shopping at. Stay away from that HM the manager is not a kind person.|0
Treated like I was invisible.  Cashiers would rather talk to each other while stuffing my merch in a bag I didn't want and taking my money I won't be giving in the future.  Selection in store was good but chaotic to navigate.|0
Annoying layout if you want to find anything. I was looking for men's slim fit stretchy shorts. Mens shorts were located in at least 5 different parts of the store. I gave up and left not finding what I wanted.|0
The store probably represents one of my personal nightmares. The lights are so bright, there is always load music but it’s not enjoyable, and it tends to attract a very young crowd of teenage girls squealing as they throw around purchases or objects that they cannot afford.|0
The music and announcements are so loud in here it feels like they're trying to make it a club. How are you supposed to shop or talk when your brain is being melted by sound?? I honestly feel bad for the sales associates, they're probably suffering hearing damage|0
I'm a huge fan of Joeys back in Alberta because of their food and service (absolutely outstanding customer service at the NE Calgary location).  The joeys here is TERRIBLE.  The same dish I order in Calgary (lobster ravioli) tasted so poorly made...and the service? ....rude & quite frankly demeaning.  The waitress got my friend's order wrong (gave her a chicken pasta instead of veggie pasta), and instead of apologizing, she made it seem like it was my friend's fault and brought the manager over.  He asked why she couldn't *just* eat the chicken!  Will never go back there again, and making sure to tell everyone about my experience.|0
The music is so loud in this store that I felt stressed. They have good prices and nice staff though.|0
Nothing much appealing, bright lighting loud music, crowded, noisy, not enough room to move, verry hot warm sweaty smells around...|0
Low quality products...color fades after washing. Some pants tearing after a couple of times in the laundry|0
Pricey item  and not that quality|0
The quality of clothes is bad but it's a cheap store.|0
Can never find wanted items in stock.|0
Not happy with the ambience in the store|0
Sales rep were no where to be found ...|0
It's not for me|0
Very low quality clothing|0
Not enough staff|0
Crowded and strange.|0
No chair for companions ... I'm going out|0
Excellent prices and nice quality, a good variety of clothes and the sales excellent. The only bad thing is the fitting rooms, they have loose curtains and a lot of people can see you from the mirror.|1
Great for three levels of Family Shopping. Location is Great for Downtown Customers & Toronto Tourists. Entrance from Street and inside the CF Eaton Centre Mall too. Always College & University students are shopping and all Students get discount too. Also in this H&M location carries Home Decor Items too. Great for Holiday Gifts Shopping too.|1
Went a long way from horribly managed launch of Comme des Garcons and Lanvin collections back in 2008 and 2010. Not looking forward to more rude staff who are unfamiliar with store policies.|1
i am giving it a 3 because i am poor xD. this place have a huge option of cloths . but they are no cheap . well it is a brand so what do you expect ?|1
Just went to return an item. 20 minutes in line with only 2 people at cash. The cashier was a bit rude..another guy who works their opened up a cash just for one of his buddies in line. How fair was that?? Staff did not look happy to be there.|1
The foot traffic was well managed and displays seems well organized and sufficiently spaced. The staff I interacted with were courteous. Really sucks that return of Instacart purchases is store credit only though!|1
Large store on many levels. Selection for women, men & children clothing and home decorating. Fast-fashion shop so selection turns over pretty quickly. Prices are fair but quality of clothing is quite poor. Don't expect merchandise to last long. Store is clean but not really laid out that well likely do to expansion of size over years. Staff is not very helpful. They seem much more interested in stocking shelves rather than assisting customers.|1
You are not allow to try clothes which is understandable with the Coronavirus but if clothes don't fit you and they are on sale  you don't get return.  You are forced to buy something else even if you don't need anything else or you don't like anything.  Instead at Joe Fresh you can try clothes on and you can buy them and even if they are on sale you get a return. That's why I say caring about the clients in these difficult times.|1
Great selection of clothes within multiple floors. There is also a home decor section. The staff is friendly and willing to help. Only downfall is that it's busy all the time. Hard to get in to try on clothes. I would give it another star but the line to the fitting room is a big problem.|1
Clean environment, kudos to the cleaners, making the store spotless clean! However some merchandiser needs to check their items often, some are being sold even they're broken or missing piece.|1
Opened fitting rooms would be great and the home decor is overpriced.|1
The customer service is not great. They are not helpful and informative. The curtains in the fitting room is soo dirty and most of them dont close properly.  Most of the room smell like feet. They should definitely do alot of cleaning and improvement in their changing rooms. The store should be at a better standard given its right at the dundas square.|1
This H&M location is huge, spans several floors and has men's, ladies, kids, and home departments. The clothes are trendy but low quality in terms of material and sewing. Music is blasting and sometimes there are screaming kids running around which makes for a stressful shopping experience. That being said, I'm usually able to find something I like here for a good price, I just have to be prepared to search for it.|1
I’d never had a bad experience here until recently.  I was in H&M kids and my autistic brother attempted to hug a mannequins  This man suddenly appeared and looked as though if I hadn’t seen him, he would have taken my brother’s arms and physically stopped him.  If he’s a customer then this is a weird security issue.  If he is an employee I would like to give some advice on handling future issues like this.  1. Without attempting to touch the child, speak to the guardian. Alert them of the situation- they probably didn’t notice. If necessary explain the risks and tell the guardian that the child cannot be doing what they’re doing.  2. If that does not work, alert a security guard to explain it to them again and to tell them that if it happens again they need to leave the store.  3. If they still haven’t kept the child from breaking rules have a security guard escort them from the store.|1
Quality of women's clothing is declining.|1
the sale event are totally worth it!!!! the other day i bought a decent cocktail party dress for about a fifth of its original price, which made my day, haha.  HOWEVER, i really dont like all the lights outside of the store. they are lit ALL DAY LONG, even during the day and late in the night, RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!! such a waste, imagine what good they could have done with that money ><|1
Do not have proper supplies. Many items out of stock. Staff don't seems to care or they may understaff. Certainly need more people on the floor|1
Remember being a kid and hiding inside the clothes racks? That was fun. Now you're old and buying your own inexpensive designer clothes that you dont need. Maybe fashion is more important than the world burning. Hmm. Gentlemen, I shop here when i need xs or small. If you are a bigger gent, I'd not spend too much time. Zara wins on quality. Did you know clothing is huge part of the garbage waste problem. Well, we shouldn't live in such a damn cold place.|1
There are some good clothes here for reasonable prices, but I don't like shopping there. Maybe I'm getting old (43) but I could hardly think with the high volume of the music. It was also hard to find help when I needed it.|1
Man, some of the customers are excellent, wonderful people. Some of them not so much. Sometimes I want to just end it all, but my team keeps me alive :) great clothes... Sometimes...|1
The staff is always kind and prompt to help you, but every time that I go there I can't find what I was looking for. The product selection is not that good if you compare to similar stores in the same mall. The Yonge & Dundas HMV street store has a better selection than the Eaton Centre's one.|1
Need to improve signaling to get around the store. Selection is good but couldn't find a single orange kid's t-shirt|1
Not too bad, a bit expensive but not much. But I couldn't find a lot of good & moderate Tshirts there, may be it's just this location though. I'll try another next time.|1
Amid the mixed reviews, I like the collection here. And the price range is good. Only difficulty is to get the right size. They have less size options.|1
"rude waitress brings out the wrong steak and when i asked  she pats me on.the back and said:"" trust me this is what you are supposed to have."" plates are stone cold, 6 steaks, zero was made right. waited very long for food."|1
I wasn't able to buy anything  why? You have limited clothing  seize. One would think I am in the specialty plus seize...you can do much better!|1
Location is large and now has a home decor section.  Great selection however staff is very hard to track down for any sizes|1
Bad return exchange and return policy. Prices not great either. Prefer Zara any day|1
Good price but clothes are more casual than uniform . Good for youth only|1
Good collection but the prices for few are outrageous|1
Quality is average. A lot of variety to make up for the quality. Prices are CHEAP. Long waiting times in the evenings for change rooms and payment|1
Quality has gone down, and prices have gone up - I used to get t-shirts and underwear here, but my last visit left me wondering where the eff I was - I felt like I was in a thrift store, but the prices were Banana Republic - I personally don't like to feel swindled or bamboozled 😂 …|1
The outlet is huge but I never ended up buying from their collection unlike other brands in the Eaton Centre.|1
It is a big brand name and so the selection is huge.  They blast the musuc though so you have to yell to be heard.|1
No plus sizes available except online. I did get a nice hat and earrings, though.|1
"One of the staff member's attitude was pretty horrible- I asked him to get something down for me and he was just like ""sigh, ok. which one."" and then proceeded to work very slowly and act like it was the hardest thing to do."|1
Very cheap clothes in price and quality. Also, lots of controversy in their ethical practices.|1
On the outside it always looks great but i fund it hard to put together a diverse outfit|1
Always too big and too crowded to find what you are looking for. The section for men is really small and limited terms of variety.|1
I think H&M is doing great in terms of style. But quality-wise, I would go Uniqlo over H&M.|1
Fast fashion has its place.|1
Cashiers are extremely slow and no staff can be found in the store|1
Good for summer clothing.|1
Not my favorite brand|1
Great style but won’t last you too long|1
The price was good, but not sure of quality.|1
I am not a big fan of this place, but they have quite a large inventory.|1
Clothes shopping for the Grand daughters.|1
It has a wide variety of clothing.|1
Not my type of clothing, but a well laid-out store.|1
Sometimes you can find good stuff there|1
Good variety, but poor clothes replacement.|1
H& M has gotten expensive - the sales arentvthat great now|1
Big store not very many staff for the size|1
Is ok New look  great prices|1
Great for clothing basics like leggings and tanks.|1
Big store and very clean|1
For good quality clothing|1
Only the sale prices Are worth investing your 💰 …|1
Fitting rooms need to be with proper doors|1
A good selection of clothes.|1
Lacking in creativity and style. Needs an overhaul|1
Variety of options, including quality and cost|1
The security tag was left on my purchase|1
Too crowded but with good prices.|1
Reasonable clothing for him and her|1
Pretty ok|1
Good collections.good prices|1

Nicely presented.|1
It was okay.|1
Budget clothing|1
La verdad no hay mucha variedad, no me gustó mucho pero si no buscas nada en especial está bien, está cerca de muchas otras tiendas, entonces puedes ir a ver y también ver las otras.  The truth is, there isn't much variety, I didn't like it very much, but if you're not looking for anything in particular, it's fine, it's close to many other stores, so you can go and see the others.|1
Encuentras muy buenos basicos. Ropa simple pero de telas muy comodas. Accesorios lindos pero no muy buena calidad. Zapatos lindos para el precio. Compre tacones de emergencia para un evento y me sirvieron de maravilla. Tienen un programa de descuento cuando llevas una bolsa de ropa que ya no vayas a utilizar. Ellos lo reciclan o lo donan.  You find very good basics. Simple clothing but very comfortable fabrics. Cute accessories but not very good quality. Cute shoes for the price. I bought emergency heels for an event and they served me wonderfully. They have a discount program when you carry a bag of clothes that you are no longer going to use. They recycle it or donate it.|1
Es un hm es buena.... sin embargo para ser temporada de rebajas y saldos no hay mucho variedad de ofertas.... :( es mejor el de queen street a 2 ó 3 cuadra de ahí  It's a hm, it's good.... however, to be the season of sales and balances, there is not much variety of offers.... :( the one on queen street is better, 2 or 3 blocks from there|1
Prices a little high and products very repetitive.|1
Reasonable! Already was better!|1
A good H&M location! Great selection, in multiple sizes. The fitting rooms were the downside. I don't know who designed this rounded curtain fitting room but I could see the people outside in the mirror through an unlosable crack in the curtain. The privacy was lacking. Don't sacrifice functionality for appearance, especially for a fitting room.|1
I've been to the H&M store in Seoul, when they reduce the price 50-60% as I have bought many fine clothes. Even here, however, 70% discount but prices are still high compared to prices in Korea. I see there aren't many clients here. Probably also because people in this city prefer other famous brands.|1
Nice variety of products. As a graphic designer, I found it a bit hard to navigate the store. Could have better signage.|1
I was trying on the items and asked for a different size of a shirt which I picked from the rack. All the sizes were there, but the girl who went for the S.W.A.T literally said it was an online return. I had to go down to pick the size by myself. I didn’t want to ask her to go check again but I work at H&M too, so I know how the price tags from online return look like. That was a dishonest customer service from that staff, and I am disappointed with her working behavior.|1
H&M The big branch of store on Eaton Center it's located on three levels and there was all kind of clothes foe kids and men and women. The place was clean and the stuff was kind and helpful. There was a little crowded and there was a line to pay. The price is firm and the quality and quantity of goods are acceptable. I recommend it.|1
I like the rate of change in the collection at this particular outlet. There is a shuffle of clothes displayed on the rack, almost, every other day. I dig the color palette of their clothes. It's often very preppy and casual. The price is affordable. The staff is sweet and helpful if you are respectful especially the ones in charge of changing rooms. The rooms are kept quite clean and they smell nice. The place itself is accessible. It is right on the side of the mall metro exit and in front of Yonge Dundas square. Can't miss it. There are two eaton mall elevators right beside the store.|1
If you're a H&M fan this store is for you, great collection and friendly staff|1
Nice clean store. Just wish they had more smaller sizes in pants.|1
The staff is always helpful - but it would help if more staff were available to help.  Sales are good ; quality is good too. I like H&M because they are tailored for a small fit. My son is tall and slim.|1
A very busy location, but always slightly messy due to the high volume of customers. The staff are constantly restocking and refolding, so it's not as though the store is being neglected. The cashiers are very friendly and the floor staff are helpful. With 3 floors, I always find many items I want. Everything is always on trend and the sale items are ridiculously inexpensive. The sizing is consistent so, once you know your size, you don't necessarily have to try everything on. The have a generous return/exchange policy, which makes returning items super easy, if you find you've made a mistake. Their jeans, in particular, are extremely well-priced. This is my go-to location. 😊|1
Large store on three levels. A bit messy, though.|1
It's for a younger crowd. I'm more uniqlo style but for the right age group H&M is inexpensive fashion and they used to accept recycled old clothing... Haven't been since the pandemic lockdown so might meed to update if they still do that service|1
Eaton branch vast space spread on three floors Women and home section is very nice|1
I like the clothes here but I think they are a bit expensive the quality is not that good for the pricebut she has nice clothes for the summer|1
Sept 26 -  warm day outside and i was in the lookout for new pair of black denim pants. H&M are always reliable when finding the items you bought several years prior.  The reason for the star deduction  is because the space is not big enough between customers and also the fact that there was an alarming amount  of people inside|1
It's good place to buy your daily casual dresses both for men and women. You can buy t-shirt starting with $7 with different varieties. Good collection of jackets, caps trousers are there. You can find few home decor stuffs but it has very limited varieties. I visited during Covid, they have proper sanitization process for visiting customers. Good to visit.|1
A huge clothing store with amazing and lively staff and great prices. It has a wide range of clothes with different designs for everyone with any age from 6 month-old babies to the grown adults of 50's. The place is very well maintained and the service is pretty quick regardless of crowded place.|1
Cheap and best place to buy clothing|1
Nice clothing store didn't go in or buy anything but yet always hope to do|1
Love their sweat shirts so comfortable and their prices are reasonable.|1
I was surprised with huge variety of displayed merchandise at Toronto downtown branch  I can always find nice things to buy at a good price at H&M|1
Should have given 5 🌟 but the security guard ruined it. Telling me that my child is messing with the child size mannequins.  Stick to your job and secure the store by stopping shoplifters not children who just want to feel the clothes on the mannequins.  Love this location because it's the first I'VE seen with a housewares section.  Maybe the ladies and children's section should be on the same floor too; seeing that women are the ones doing most of the children shopping. It's a hassle to browse the ladies section then have to run downstairs to the children's... Especially if you have a stroller and cannot use the escalator.|1
H&M is a scary place. Lots of fashion zombies walking around trying stuff on. Clones, so many clones that you will think you're on Kamino|1
The male section is on the bottom floor but it has a large selection and the staff is nice. The store itself is clean and it's easy to get to the rest of Eaton center too after you are done shopping here.|1
This is a huge location. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, not all of the changing rooms were open and the lines were too big at the ones that were open.|1
"They closed half the change rooms probably ""for covid safety"" so now instead everyone stands in a massive line 6 inches from each other between the racks of clothes"|1
This location has a small home decor section (dining, pillows, throws, candles, bed & bath) - trendy colours & styles - pricing was great. Worth checking out.|1
I love the styles here at H&M it is my favorite place to shop , but sometimes I find the staff not very happy and they don't like to answer questions ( some other staff are very nice though).|1
Clothes are affordable, styles are good as well. Problem I faced is finding right size . I dint get my size in the style I’m looking for|1
They always have a  good variety of sizes and design. This is my favorite HM store so far stocks are well organized and staff are friendly.|1
Clean  organized      technical issues with gift cards   added to some time spent waiting  but such is life|1
Really good place. Lot of rush!! Good prices!! People are nice!! Spotlights they use make u look better in what you are wearing. Lot of selections!!|1
Great selection of kids, women and men's clothing. Reasonable prices. Also have home decor, shoes, and accessories. Highly recommended.|1
Nice clothe, a bit on the high side but affordable.|1
The store is big, they have good sales and the manager really helped me out when I had some issues with a return. She was very honest and understanding!|1
Super nice store, with different types of size and model of clothes you can find T-shirts, skirts, drees, boots different colors good prices|1
Great place to shop for decent personal or professional clothing. The store has so much to offer and the atmosphere is so lovely.|1
Very large store on several floors. Well located in the DT heart.|1
One of my favorite places to shop , as I said on another posting work more on customer service and satisfaction but it is not only on this store it seems that customer service it's been forgotten as on many stores the re is no friendliness on service|1
Service at this location is excellent. I was looking for a specific dinosaur t-shirt for my nephew and I was helped by a very nice sales associate.|1
Standard store with lots if good selection and staff. Not usually crazy busy so there's not a lot of wait to try stuff|1
Good selection of cheap and fashionable clothes for men and women|1
Huge store and selection. Staff are helpful and friendly. Houseware section has beautiful items!|1
Good collection of clothing at affordable prices. There is a sale going on most times and you can get a further discount|1
I had to say that I had a late lunch there and it just took a long time for our server to come up to us and ask us for our drinks and then for our food order. Then waiting for the food... To sum it up. It took forever. It's more of a place for just conversation that would go for hours.|1
The staff seemed very helpful and they also have good collection for formal sweaters.|1
Good selection of the clothing and the store is kept pretty tidy. The staff are well informed.|1
Particularly fun place for the ladies. Just ask my wife! Great store,  wide selection.|1
Nice selection of both ladies n gents items.|1
Shout out to Clavin in the home department who was so damn nice and helpful!|1
Nice store. Lots of fashions. Prices are reasonable. Crowded with bargain hunters.|1

Great items but too vast Constantly needed staff's help for navigation|1
Awesome fish tacos, drinks are good, service can be great or sub par depending on your waiter.|1
Modern, big, and everything I want I found here. Incredibly expensive for what it is, but I'm not complaining.|1
Very large H&M shop. There are a lot of clothes for all people, include decorating home things.|1
Great selections of men & ladies clothing store with very reasonable prices.|1
Very excited to see that H&M has atheltic wear and home decor!|1
It's fast fashion, but the look and quality is actually quite good for what you're paying.|1
i like h&m in general and this one is a wide one so overall it's better than most i'd say|1
Great selection, decent prices. Wish they had their European lines in Canada.|1
Nice outfit for work .For casual to stylish ,you have a good choice|1

Eaton centre|1
Una tienda con bastante surtido, buenos diseños, más orientados a la moda europea, estilizados y con colores más sobrios. La calidad de la ropa es regular, sin embargo las rebajas son bastante buenas, puedes encontrar prendas por 8 o 9 dólares en el área de ofertas. Si te encuentras por el centro de Toronto es una opción. Recomiendo explorar todos los niveles.  A store with a large assortment, good designs, more oriented towards European fashion, stylized and with more sober colours. The quality of the clothes is regular, however the sales are quite good, you can find clothes for 8 or 9 dollars in the sales area. If you are in downtown Toronto it is an option. I recommend exploring all levels.|1
La tienda es de buen tamaño, lo que me gusta de esta tienda es que tienen ropa con diseños de la marca y de licencias por ejemplo de NASA, Disney , etc. El personal es muy amable y te apoyan en lo que puedan. Te ayudan a encontrar tallas súper rápido, lo que no me agradó es que estaba muy desordenado.  The store is a good size, what I like about this store is that they have clothes with designs of the brand and licenses for example from NASA, Disney, etc. The staff is very friendly and help you in any way they can. They help you find sizes super fast, what I didn't like was that it was very messy.|1
Extensa tienda de ropa con amplia variedad en prendas para caballero y dama. Precios no tan altos, falta un poco de señalización para ubicarse en tan amplio local. Buena calidad de ropa  Extensive clothing store with a wide variety of garments for men and women. Prices not so high, a bit of signage is needed to be located in such a large place. Good quality of clothes|1
It's a good department store like Riachuelo C&A and others in Brazil good clothes at good prices I like to buy in this store|1
Buena ropa pero no tiene mucha variedad para caballeros. La ropa de mujer alguna muy bonita.  Good clothes but not much variety for men. Women's clothing some very pretty.|1
Geniales precios y variedad  Great prices and variety|1
Excellent women's and men's clothing and accessories store with attractive prices.|1
An excellent place for those looking for cheap prices, especially good for children|1

I was checked out by Sarushti who was amazing she greeted us so politely acknowledged my 7 year as well and offered us to sign up for H & M rewards and helped us get an additional 10 percents off. The deals were great to begin with and the store it self looked and felt very organized!|1
It’s their flag ship next to Dundas square. The store  just got renovated I believe a couple a years ago . So it looks really good. From The lights and the  design  of the store to the collections  they keep changing on weekly basis. Def best H&M in Toronto hands down|1
Bought this beautiful long ribbed dress from H&M! I tried it on and it fit me amazingly! I love it so much. I feel like this location H&M has more stuff than the other location I guess because this location is bigger! Still very beautiful and modest dress😍🙌🏼 …|1
I love that they have clothing attire for almost every occasion and their pricing is not so bad. I love their winter collections and will most certainly be back. I recommend|1
I love this H&M, the organization of the store is amazing, and seems to be the only H&M where the sizing is accurate. I'm a bit of a bigger guy and usually at other H&M's I need a 4XL which is not accurate, at this store I can always find a L or XL that fits perfectly. If your going to an H&M it's worth it to go to this location.|1
3 stories of H & M and shopping. It is a lovely store. The layout is nice and spacious. Nice shopping experience.|1
Hi Anne Marie (Store Manager)! Thankyou for being so accommodating with my return today! I really appreciate your superb customer service!!|1
Huge place to shop for really stylish and budget options for mens/women and kids. This place is right above Yonge and Dundas subway. Very reachable and convenient.|1
"This store is like a fashion wonderland.  So many choices, all organized and displayed in a clear and uncluttered way.  I went to try something on, and the attendant was so polite.  He thanked me for trying stuff on (this never happens anywhere) and when I told him I was going to take some of the items, he said, ""Oh great!"", like he was happy for me, lol.  The other staff also seemed happy and though they were working, they were laughing together and seemed relaxed.  This was really nice to see. Security is in place but not overbearing or in your way.  I will definitely return for more fashion inspiration at this flagship location."|1
When we arrived at H&M, it was pretty easy to find what we Were looking for. The few time we needed assistance, the staff were available to provide it. It was a smooth in and out experience.|1
Nice place good staff cooperation. Little busy with the line. But that’s what you can expect with the store serving well and good collection.  Recommend ✨✨✨✨✨|1
It is a very crowded place all the time . So many customers goes here everyday. Very nice decoration inside the showroom. Separate place for men-women- children. And they have separate changing rooms also. This brand shop is very convenient and budget friendly. Canada’s first H&M store opened on March 11th, 2004 at Toronto’s Fairview Mall. The 12,000 square foot store was met with much fanfare and a week later, its second Canadian location opened at The Promenade in Thornhill, just north of Toronto. Canada’s largest H&M location (at 33,000 square feet) opened in the fall of 2004 at the Toronto Eaton Centre.|1
Our go-to for good quality, fashionable clothing at reasonable prices. Kids' clothing, especially, is very high quality and washes well. Women's clothing, as well. Love this blazers and trousers- favourite work pieces. This store is well organized and easy (enough) to navigate, considering it spans multiple levels.|1
Best store in downtown Toronto located at Dundas street, offering huge sale and promotions on summer collection therefore don't miss this opportunity and rush towards h&m of you are in toronto.i shopped allot ajd quality was awesome as compare to prices, all the stuff are nicely designed with beautiful color collection. İt is recommended for time being as i enjoyed shopping|1
This is a very good spot. I went here with my daughters and they found a great variety on clothing and accessories. They had fun choosing some of their favorite things and getting they liked the best. Good quality clothing, reasonable cost and trendy stuff. Good combination. The waiting time for the fitting rooms though, was a bit long. Not sure if this is because it was a Friday or this is always like that. Anyway, we'll be coming back. My daughters liked the experience at this place.|1
Nice store, huge range of styles|1
I have always loved the type of clothes they offer. The deals are always great. I got my graduation Sandals from there and they are very comfortable. Above that, I got one high waist jean which turned out to be a perfect for me. They provide amazing customer service and it’s reasonable if you follow the offers.|1
This H&M is located in the Eaton center just at the Dundas square. It is a big store with a good collection of clothes and apparels. Their prices are reasonable and competitive. We like this brand because of the quality of the products. So far, we have positive experience at this store. We actually come to this place quite frequently as to get access to the mall. Outside H&M, you will find some gathering and events that make you feel lively. I would definitely recommend this place.|1
Super impressed with how this location has handled sanitization re: covid. They stagger changerooms and thoroughly wipe down in between people. This is the most I've seen done at any retail clothing store. The selection here is also great as it's quite large (3 stories).|1
This H&M location is superb. Recently renovated and expanded, this store is the largest H&M I have ever seen and it includes H&M, H&M Man, H&M Kids, and H&M Home branches all in the same store. There is always a great selection of products at affordable prices. If you are looking for clearance though, you should try another location as this location doesn't typically have much clearance options due to its high-traffic location, dependancy on tourist revenue, and iconic status in the Eaton Centre.  Overall, a fantastic H&M location and a great place to find new clothes, shoes, and home decor.|1
Fabulous variety of styles and price range, and marked down items of clothing also pretty good.|1
Have been looking forever for white cotton tube top, strapless bra for a certain sundress. Finally found the perfect one at H & M for about $17 CAD. Thrilled. Eyelet cotton is pretty and very comfy. Doesn't fall down becuz has side wire. ❤️|1
The store is huge and the selection is endless, their place looks full and vibrant. the customer service is really good|1
First time in H&M to actually shop in years, and i am very impressed with the renovations and how things are now. Ultra crowded though, but there's a HUGE selection of merchandise. I really liked the lighting, the cleanliness of the floor, and the ability to have a conversation with the staff. Change rooms were clean and private with a 7 item limit and the mirror allowed for perfect selfies. Nothing negative to say about it other than it being crowded on weekends, and a bit tough to navigate with so much stuff around, but I suppose that's Marketing 101 anyway.|1
Clean well lit and spacious layout.|1
It was an amazing experience while I visit H&M, Eaton Centre. I found wide range of design, colors and size options. I would like to suggest, please go for Indian shirts and trousers for your smart looks and comfort!! You'll be definitely benefited in terms of cost, comfort and looks!!|1
This location has wide variety of nice stuff! Customer service is top notch!|1
Great sales and selection for both men and women. Love to come here for basics.|1
If clubs to reopen , this is where I would go to get disposable clothing I'm talking about V neck and crew neck tops for $5 if you really need a cheap pair of jeans for a special occasion that you're probly gonna throw out or spill something on, this is where you would go because it would cost you under $20 for an outfit. Places like this are essential in this economic time period during the pandemic this store was the 1st to open their flagship store and stay open when stores reopen. They all were able to open during the end of phase one|1
Very understanding and polite staff. 👍 …|1
During COVID-19 (August), sanitizer at the doors, specific ways you are suppose to walk around the store. As for products they have lots of variety at this location including houseware items, decor, kid's section, women's and men's. Reccomend going to this location as you could probably find almost everything you are looking for fashion wise.|1
My favourite location of H&M. Staff is helpful. I like the layout of all the clothes here. Somehow the other locations don't cut it. And the prices are not too bad either.|1
I've been going to Joey for over a year now. I go once a week (literally, every week). The food is great. The price is reasonable for what you get. There are plenty of TVs in the bar for watching sports. During the summer, they open the walls up in one section of the dining area so you can almost sit outside.|1
Great clothing for a reasonable cost! The tops look appealing and bottoms are one of a kind. Every visit to the mall guarantees a visit to H & M.|1
My Favorite H&M in Toronto, always has sizes . Display is so not crowded. Staff  check up on you which is unheard of for this store. No matter where I am, I'll wait to get back to this location. second floor has great sales|1
Great store, very clean with interesting layout, helpful staff and good selection.|1
Great store for summer collection, lots of designs and sizes available for everyone|1
Lots of variety!|1
Amazing Deal of the Day. Throw Pillow Covers, 100 percent Cotton at $1:99. They didn't last very long. Beat that Dollarama.  Spring is here at H&M. My favorite section at H&M Eaton Centre. Housewares.  H&M accepts Cash, Debit, Visa and Master Card. They do not Accept American Express card.|1
I purchased a men’s belt on July 3,2022 at this store. When I approached the cash counter no greeting what’s so ever. A tall young black male behind the counter cashed me out. Not a word during the whole time. I told him the belt on sale on H&M website and show him the price. He cashed me out by saying no return on sale item. I asked him if possible to punch more holes on the belt he unwillingly replied “no”. No “hi”, no “thank you” nothing the whole time while I was there. May be I’m an old fashion simple thank you would long way. To me, it appears he doesn’t want to be there serving customers. He need to understand there are many young people loved to have a job like he has.|0
Hate this place no one helps you the store is so messy.  Can never find what I want. The one in  Hillcrest is much better|0
The store does not update their inventory ever. Drove 30 minutes just to find out that every size was sold and not a single piece of item was available when it showed online that all sizes were available for that item. Zero care from the workers or management.|0
I wish I could rate the customer service a 0! I wanted to exchange an item. I had a gift receipt and the store manager would not offer me an exchange or a  store credit. Item had tags on it, was never worn and was a Christmas gift.  I assured her that I was about to spend alot more and she was very rude and would not help. Be prepared, if you want to return something at this store, they DO NOT honour their store policy and the manager will give you a hard time.  I will never shop at this location again. I will support other locations or buy online. This post is strictly based on my experience with the store manager. I contacted head office and I hope she is spoken to about how she speaks to her customers.|0
POOREST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER EXPERIENCED IN AN H&M. THE EMPLOYEE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE AND HAD ZERO LITERALLY ZERO SENSE OF HIS OWN STORE. NEVER COMING BACKK|0
It’s always so nice hearing staff that work at the store talking about how dumb customers are because of simple questions being asked, definitely not okay. It was a woman with blunt black hair that worked may 31st 2022 wearing a green top at 7:16 pm near the front of the store|0
Dear H&M even if you dont allow returns for selected items, at least do so if a product is defective. Well what can a large company lose so you wont probably care. Talk about you get what you pay for principle|0
Went to Vaughan Mills last night Waited 25 minutes to get into the mall Picked out what I wanted from  H&M. Product I had to exchange still had tags on them and was told Sorry we can't exchange it. I was baffled as I have no issues anywhere else I was returning the same top just for a smaller size. Really Frustrating  .  Poor quality for customer service as not even the manager would try to come up with a solution.|0
This is the worst H&M in the GTA! Do not shop here. This store is run by some horrible troll Karen who yells at customers when they have issues. I tried to return two spring jackets I bought within the hour. The troll lady denied the refund because they were sale items. I was neither aware nor was I told that sale items were final when I was cashing out. (very dishonest policy but that’s another story)  She  (maybe a he?) then started shouting at me and so rudely stated that I couldn’t read because the return policy is on the receipt.  When I responded she charged at me and then threatened to call security on me (lowkey a racial attack because I’m a black male re: Central Park Karen lady)  I’m so disgusted. I will never shop at H&M again.|0
Went into the vaughanmills location on July 28th around 630pm  to shop and was treated with such rude and unapproachable manner by seems to be MOD on duty ..she was petite Asian and when i approached her to ask return policy for sale items and where the cash counter was..she rolled her  eyes and pointed at cash as i was inconveniencing her. Imagine the rest of the team must be treating other customers if the manager on duty was acting in such manner. I will not be returning tp thi location. Totally unprofessional manner. I will go to that location again.|0
Don't shop at H&M. Tried to exchange an Xmas gift for my child. I had the pants in my hand the return and the exact same pants just 2 sizes larger. They refused to do the exchange. So arrogant and rude. We don't do exchanges without receipts. Same pants just larger and you say no. what is this world coming to. This company will definitely be out of business soon.|0
Messy store. Unhelpful workers. Asked one a question he completely ignored me and I asked again and he ignored me for a call on his radio intercom. Ended up not buying anything because 3 different employees walked into me and pushed passed me. Rather then waiting the 5 secs for me to get where I’m going.|0
This H&M is simply terrible in customer service. The employees are unprofessional in past couple of times I visited. Even the managers are rude with lack of knowledge about their own promotions. I visited other H&M and never had any problems but here in Vaughan Mills, every single time they drive me crazy. Could you please teach your employees and manager in this branch how to respect customers and teach them about H&M promotions and policies. I know H&M policies better than the managers that I had to show them the print out even once. So disgusting and disappointing! Never ever gonna shop in this branch.|0
This is the worst H&M i have been to in my entire life. I have lived in Sweden for many years and know how H&M operates. I go to the one in Eaton centre and Bloor, those are my local ones, the stuff is great and know how to keep their stores clean. But this time, we decided to go there thanks to the Lego Discovery Centre.  I had a terrible accident in there due to their negligence, and still nursing my injury 3 weeks later. They had no 1st aid kit, they were terrible with first aid, as a family we had to DIY the 1st aid. They took our details and said they were gonna check on me that very week. NEVER HAPPENED! I am still waiting, but 3 weeks later, come on.|0
Horrible service. Staff is extremely rude. I just got surgery and ask to have some stuff held at the front so I couldn’t carry is. They lost all the stuff I put in the front within a matter of 5 min. I had to go recollect what I could injured. Then she gave me back over $50 in 10s when there was bigger bills in the till and I asked for them.|0
I attempted to return a single item without a receipt at this store last weekend. They gave me a number to call customer service and C. service didn't do anything for me; useless. The manager at this store came off as EXTREMELY ARROGANT and rude. I'm not coming back here.|0
This H&M provides unbelievably disgusting customer service. H&M itself is one of the best fashion retails and always has the best prices and qualities but staff here are extremely rude! If you think you call a manager and attitudes are going to change?! WRONG! Managers are the same...they are working there to ruin your shopping experience. If you call for help, they gonna ignore you...if you complain about that, they gonna blame you!!!!!! If you call this store for a check, no answer! If you want to pay for ur items, don't expect any kind of greeting at cash. Try to go to yorkdale or hillcrest mall! They provide good service|0
For the life of me I can't stand ANY of the employees at this location they are so rude, unhelpful, disrespectful and FULL OF ATTITUDE. H&M as a company is appreciated because of their selection of clothing and return policy...  but please please please, hire BETTER STAFF.|0
At no point did anyone approach to help! We left... not good.|0
A male manager yesterday i had an issue and  he was called to cash he didnt deal with the situation appropriately very rude and not listening to none of concerns and walked off and didnt resolve the issue .This H&M management team is very poor do not recommend shopping in here very mess in the store|0
Really rude, unprofessional staffs.|0
In this location, Staff need to have more training to provide better customer service!! Employees are unprofessional! Customer service is much better in Yorkdale Mall.|0
Terribly long lines. Barely staffed checkouts|0
Love the Company- shop there often. Poor customer service very rude and unprofessional never satisfied when purchasing items.|0
Cashier that deal with me didn't want me to use my discount and came up with stupid excuse. Very disappointed|0
Zero customer service.|0
the white cashier with glasses, screwed up my checkout and forgot to take off the security tag of my tee. smh|0
Never been here but google says I was|0
Zero customer service dont bother to ask anything they will not help you!!|0
Very rud and impolite staffs specially the managers|0
Parking is scarce, traffic in the vicinity is insane, the mall is too big to shop effecitvely. Yawn Mills.|0
Worst store.  Doesn’t treat people like humans. Don’t work here.|0
The staff rudely disconnects when you call the store. No courtesy. No customer service.|0
poorest customer service ever , employee doesn’t know how to talk to customer|0
Worst quality of clothes.I will not buy it again|0
Worst customer service and employee are   been so rude towards customers.|0
Low quality....stay away|0
Lazy and rude|0
Never been there|0
Browsed around the store last Thursday morning. It seemed like everyone was working at a snails pace except for two staff members (the girl in the fitting room + a young man at the men’s pay/checkout area). Everyone else clearly needed some coffee. Store seemed tidy, wide selection of items to choose from but not the best customer service. I suggest shopping at another H&M location, or online|0
No mirrors placed anywhere in the store. - a very elaborate strategy by management to make people go to the fitting rooms if they need a mirror.|0
I bought a scarf set with glove and tam I didn't notice one of the gloves was missing until I got home. I live way to far to go back for it so it's just a lost for me I mean I can still rock the scarf and tam but I had to use an old black glove I had to wear with my new one glove problem solved I guess but h&m needs to make sure their items are fully stock with all that comes with it. Other than that nice clothes.|0
I loved the place a couple years ago but something changed, no it wasn’t the prices or the service. Something just felt off as if something or someone was missing, i can’t very well put my finger on it.. But i definitely miss whatever it was. I will admit some of the sales associates are amazing and they provide great service! Even when it gets busy the employees definitely know how to work under pressure delivering great customer service, at a very efficient rate! & they got rid of divided grey for men..|0
To much expensive but less quantity.  Can't find good quality wearing|0
Not really the tidiest of H&M you might find around. The cloths are all mixed up and is really difficult to find a particular type. Being in Vaughan Mills makes it more crowded. Visit an H&M at a nearby mall near you and you can find what you are looking for much easily.|0
Stood at cashier while two employees walked right past me. A third employee came and said cash was closed. How about a sign? How about acknowledging a customer and saying this cash is closed but someone can help you at another cash. I left without  buying..|0
Nothing special, only one of the hundreds of H&M locations. Used to have good deals as it's in an outlet mall but those good old days are gone...|0
It’s cheap retail I get it, but at least take the security tags off my clothes I bought ☠️.|0
No good sales and choices for boys clothing. Nevertheless, customer service was very good.|0
Hated it. Some good stores but the people that go here. omg|0
They downsized their area of kids fashion, probably due to covid|0
Customers need to take pride and not throw the merchandise on the floor.|0
Not cheap better online|0
After covid, poor choices|0
Don’t like the stuff.|0
Terrible washrooms|0
H&M at Vaughan Mills is a decent store to visit when looking for mens or womens apparel. The quality of clothing is not the best but fair for the price points. The store follows Covid-19 protocols and ensures everyone has a mask. The store is somewhat clean and organized. I'd recommend visiting other apparel stores but H&M is good enough as well.|1
This place is good for shopping.  Specially the kid's section.|1
Well, quite a decent collection for winter. Could have been better for women. However, the overall collection from spring and summer perspective is definitely a thumbs up.|1
Big posters of huge discounts outside but very small portion of clothing was on sale with discount and even that looked old. I understand that it was because of COVID situation but still other brands had better selection.|1
I had a fair experience. The staff was friendly. My husband and I  were shopping for dress shirts for him. There was not a huge selection compared to the one at Eaton. Decent enough.|1
Noticeable decline in the quality and style of clothing, everything seems to going to sweats, hardly any dress clothing like before. They are losing ground to their main competition ZARA. The staff are non exists except for a cashier and a couple folding clothes. Definitely not what they used to be, this should be a wake up call for H&M.|1
Store was organized, just can't seem to justify spending money at this store when there is a Uniqlo in the same mall|1
Regular store. Unfortunately they don't let you  go in with your kid to try on clothes... I won't come again.|1
Bigger store, good selection & the usual prices.  Not to busy, parking easy.  Nothing special, no higher end style lines like downtown.|1
Their kids clothes looks pretty much the same as 4 years ago. Nothing special.|1
An inexpensive way to stay within trend. Very crowded; but worth it for inexpensive trendy basics. The quality here is definitely mixed.|1
It is nice store|1
I ise to loove H&m clothes but now i don't know what happend nuthing nice and the prices is so much even they have salle|1
I called costumer service to put a pair of linen shorts on hold which i was told they have Took the Tole hwy got there and they didn't have no shorts for me|1
Good range of color of clothing, but not much for the men section|1
its ok|1
I don't see much collections in vaughan mills store. I would say visit Yorkdale or Eaton centre|1
Some good priced items|1
Nice store just wish there was better guy selection there for better price.|1
Nice big store but no A/C and it is too hot|1
Cashier forgot security tag  on my daughter's shoes.|1
Good prices but mostly not very good quality! Also items are not true to size most of the times!|1
Vaughan Mills location of H&M had good varity of clothing and staff is helpful|1
Good one for kids. .|1
Did not find anything right with price.|1
The store doesn't really interest me it's just meh maybe other people would like the style of this store|1
Clothes quality is getting worse|1
Located in a big mall, great place to buy basic clothing.|1
They have nice stuff at affordable prices|1
Lots of sale going on mostly large sizes are left|1
Its an h and m.... Not organized at all so hars to shop|1
SOME SALES PERSON IS NOT SUPPORTIVE , EVEN THEY ARGUE WITH EACH OTHER IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMER,I THINK MANAGEMENT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ..|1
Their clothing type is really a bit of a mess. Nothing for tall people.|1
Not a good sale..no new variety..|1
You can find modest clothing here|1
A few years ago price and quality. Now.....|1
Good|1
They need more mirrors and fitting rooms at this location.|1
Customer service could be better|1
Men’s cashier was impolite!|1
go shopping|1
There is a low in a stock|1
Ok|1
Ok|1
Decent collection|1
To item to select.|1
Okay|1
Huge collection|1
The stores have been refreshed but the Men's Line is not as good & lacking quality offerings.|1
I don't like their goods|1
I was looking for clothes for my teenage daughters. Unfortunately, the prices were too high, there were no promotions. I left disappointed even though I love this brand.|1
Didn't find very many options this time especially for men...but by and large great for casual wear|1
Big location with plenty of selection and variety along with good deals, especially for kids clothing. Lineups can be long with limited amount of cashiers but cash registers in both men's and women section.|1
Employees were courteous albeit incompetent and inconsistent with phone customer service|1
I found good promotions.  The only thing is that, it would be worth it if people did not leave clothes lying around and disorganize them.|1
Nice store a lot of choices to choose from from Baby, Kids, Men's and Women's clothing. A bit crowded.|1
I felt like this store, of all h&m's, had me a little bit lost. The same pants (or they looked the same) were in different spots so every time I saw black jeans I was disappointed because they were the same I saw before! Or maybe you just have a bunch of black jeans that look the same all over the store!|1
They have a awsome collection of cloths. Love the quality of there cloths . Kids cloths are just wow.  Nice designs and great fabric. Store on vaughan mills takes covid19 precautions as well. Allow only limited people inside the store.|1
H&M is a store where clothing is purchased  the store is very white not in ethnicity just looks very white on inside theres white cellings white floors and white people|1
Great customer service, helped with quite a few suggestions and were very patient with our little ones. The cashier even helped us save a bit more by using the H&M app because “diapers are expensive”...I agree haha. Anyways my only problem was that a lot of the sizing wasn’t available and it was very disorganized (can forgive for a late Saturday afternoon visit). Staff were busy folding and putting clothes away, it’s just a shame customers can be so shameless and messy lol.|1
Went here with my daughter, we bought her a childrens frozen watch/bracelet. The gentleman who helped us (I cannot find his name on our receipt just till 8 #5418) on the mens side cashed us out. He was so nice to our 3 year old and made conversation with her. Even asked if he could put it on for her, she loved it!!!|1
Normally the people here are nice and friendly and the service is good and fast when it's not peak times such as the weekend. Aside from the fact that once i was asked by an associate to prove I qas was with Virgin Mobile because of a discount I was using which I did not appreciate. Also, I bought a bathing suit before my trip and the associate helping me forgot to take off the huge tag / security sensor thing so i couldn't take it on my trip.|1
Scandinavian Clothing store in Vaughan Mills mall.|1
Very reasonable prices .. could use more staff (or any staff) on the floor|1
Good quality clothes at reasonable price.. ..they have sections for men  and women at Vaughan mills... trying room also available.. if you are virgin mobile user, you can get a discount here by getting a code from virgin member benefits...|1
I visited last Saturday and there was an amazing sell|1
They do not carry many items in size xs or small. But overall my experience was good and no complaints|1
Loved this place. Has got perfect outfits, got few tee for nightwear for $7. That's it for H&M. NOT BAD.|1
Staff is nice, lets of deals on clothing for back to school for kids. Could've find anything I like for myself,  but for the kids was good.|1
Found not much variety and sizes this time maybe because of covid|1
Good selection and reasonable prices. We got additional 10 ℅ discount after sign up on their website.|1
Not much selection this time I went. And their kids cash is always closed. Why even have it there? Put more clothes there then! Lol|1
I am glad it's open, but due to covid situation the fitting room is closed. Therefore, you have to revisit if it didn't fit.|1
Went to pick up a few t-shirts, quick in and out, it was my first time there|1
Pretty big H&M, well stocked, very bright.|1
Love the selection|1
You can find dress clothes and casual clothing at a reasonable price, the staff was friendly and helpful.|1
overall quality stuff , always compare with competitors then buy, panda is welcoming kids on Saturday 8/10/16'|1
the line tp get in was long but it was cool either way.|1
Load's of bargains available, shopping 🛒🛍️ time …|1

A big and beautiful place and many deals with a large selection|1
Really nice clothing store! There is a wide selection of clothing for kids! Staff is really helfful. Really nice clothing store! Overall a great clothing store! I highly recommend this place!|1
I love H & M, never a time a left the place empty handed. So many fabulous items you can get at a fair price. The place is always on the go with current trends which what i love about them|1
Prices are very reasonable. The quality is decent.|1
Good choices of clothes to choose from for little kids to teens. Good.safety measure and staff is also very helpful.|1
Very decent prices for quality clothing. They have large variety for Men and Women, not so much for babies.|1
I love shopping in this store, always has nice clothing and so fashionable.|1
Hi..just read a review where H&M didnt exchange your purchase. This is not correct. Due to covid their policy allows 30 days exchange as you cannot try on clothes at the store or you choose not too. Try another location im sure you will succeed. I did exact same thing with no issues..Heartland location.|1
Great sales in time for Christmas. Honestly clothes are all the same year after year but everything is fairly priced and quality reflects it.|1
Jeremy was great, thanks for cashing us out so quick!|1
Thank you very, Michelle, for your help, patience and guidance! It was my first experience using Instacart, and I was having some difficulties. I was given a task to pick up clothes for my uncle who is getting married. I picked up a women's blouse and kids pants for my uncle. LOL! Michelle was my saviour who didn't make assumptions and constantly communicated everything over the app. She asked all the right questions and quickly figured out my mistake. She helped me pick the right clothes and guided me every step of the way! Thank you very much, Michelle, for going above and beyond the call of duty! It was already a very stressful day for me, and your presence of mind saved me! I wish you all the success in the world.|1
Nice selection of kids clothes|1
Nice place of market for all things|1
You can find bargains under $10 - amazing price/quality. This store could have more employees as it's not always easy to find items. Expect a long check out queue.|1
Excellent store with very helpful staff and very good selection of both menswear and women's fashions.|1
Good sales. Very organized store. Don't expect high quality clothes. It's just affordable clothes you wear and get rid of once they've served their purpose.|1
Large H&M with wide selection of women's, men's, and children's clothing. This location does not have home items. There is an entrance from outside the mall as well as access to the store through the mall. This H&M location keeps mall hours and opens and closes at the same time as mall hours are stated. Although Vaughan Mills does have some outlet stores, this H&M is NOT an outlet, it is a regular clothing store with the same in season clothing items available at other locations and online.|1
I used to work in a  stores like D&G,EA,Gucci and i know what means buy expansive stuff.i Also understand that give a lot of momey for just clothes its kind of,you know...H&M is the store where the price range and style makes me feel comfortable.Thank you H&M you are one of my favourite Brands.|1
I love the stores in this mall.  To highlight a few, they have an UGG store, which is awesome.  They are also getting a Legoland in March which basically will make every child want to go shopping with their mother.  The Bass Pro makes my husband actually okay with going shopping with me and they have a Safari store that is like a huge pet store which is very fun for kids.  The layout of the mall is great and it's really easy to get around for people who are disabled.  My husband pulled a tendon in his leg and can't walk at the moment and they had motorized scooter so he was able to get around easily.|1
Large collection of clothing for men, women, and children. Located conveniently with in Vaughan Mills Mall with access from inside the mall and parking lot. Genuine sales items available. Must check out for yout clothing needs.|1
It's a good store. I do shop here once in a while.|1
I was surprised by the summer collection here and good deals!|1
The Best store ! Lot of collections for men and women clothing. Good customer service and the staffs are very helpful. Got good deals ! Its good to Subscribe their promotions and buy clothes during their best deals|1

I realized why I never shop from this brand again. I pass by because I need urgently to buy simple t-shirt.  I’ve been waiting on the line for 20 minutes although there is no one in front of me because they’re lack of stuff. Well I lost 30 mins and my mood. Pay 5$ more go to another store|0
Nice store however their changing room policy is ridiculous. I waited in line which was quite long, but understandable it's the weekend. There is a 7 item limit and I had 12. I split them in half to stay within the limit. However when I wanted to try the second half of my outfits I was told that I need to redo the line. It's a first time I ever hear that in a store. I already waited in line and only needed a few more minutes to try the rest of my clothes. Overall it ruined the visit because I wasn't able to try the rest of my items|0
Some cashiers are really unprofessional and horrible at dealing with costumers unfortunately. Being polite is free btw!|0
Goggle said the store closes at 6pm and so does the sign at the door. I got there at 5:33pm and they locked the doors already!|0
Awful experience with the store employees, absolutely nonprofessional, lack customer service etiquettes. A store employee started chasing my family right from the time we entered the kids area. She would come and instruct us not to do this or that and later misguided about the changing room. I argued about her behavior ansmd she called her supervisor and this guy was worse than her. He asked me to arrange the clothes that we tried which was against the customer service rules. Both the supervisor and the employee made sure that i don't come to  H&M again. I wrote a complain but no reesponse yet. I would recommend h&m to teach ethics to your employees.|0
The people working at this store are insufferable.  Spend your money and time elsewhere!|0
Nice store, awful service. Tried to exchange my 5yr old granddaughter's shoes I bought the day before which had a manufacturing defect. (The inside sole in the left shoe was bend and glued in half creating a bump which wasn't visible when I bought it.) When the two girls at service desk  refused the exchange I asked for the supervisor (refused to identify herself) who told me that the shoes didn't look brand new. The next day I went to H&M Rockland branch where everything was settled in 5 minutes.|0
Long time customer who quit the store for good. Customer services will straight lie to you saying they can't get back your receipt. Was just trying to exchange an item for a different size.|0
I had the worst experience of shopping in this store of H&M yesterday. I forgot my mask and just covered my face, then went to the cashier to ask if they can give me a mask, they told me No. Then I went towards the exit door, looking at items, while I was still covering my face, I saw the cashier came to me and literally throw me out of the store in a very disrespectful way. His behaviour to me was super offensive and really disrespectful. The point is that mask obligation will be removed from the next week in Quebec and it has been removed last month in Ontario. I will not comeback to this store again.|0
Would give a 0 if possible, nothing wrong with the store or the merchandise but what a rude staff! Manager decided to close down the fitting rooms one day before Christmas to “protect” his staff while rest of shop was heaving with shoppers, anyway, manager is the most disrespectful and hate filled human being I had to lay my eyes on. But he didn’t ruin Christmas for me man! Love conquers all!|0
Rediculous behaviour and unkind staff, i wanted to acompany my mom in fitting room just a moment to see how the dress fits, they didnt let me , what is this rule, why you need such a rule in fitting room, it was just for a moment???!!!!|0
I usually love H&M and the people who work there, but this one girl made it a nightmare. She wears circular glasses and has wavy hair. Her coworker referred to her as Camilla or something close. I don't believe fits the H&M image… she was terribly, and I mean extremely, nasty to customers. I can tell she feel superior…|0
the employee wasn’t aware of the brand’s policies and decided to gaslighted me instead, not a fun experience and left empty handed instead|0
When I wanted to go in for a quick browse, the guy at the door stopped me and stated that their policy is to not let anyone in 20 min  before the closing time.They should really change the closing time if that is the case.|0
worst h&m i have seen. employees and the manager’s are very rude. It’s seems like they don’t like there job, it’s sad too see that in customer service.|0
Please check your checkout bag before leaving as the cashiers are a bit incompetent of bagging all your products. Once you face a problem with H&M do not expect customers service.|0
The staffs were really rude. They behaved with me like they are my boss and even yelled at me from behind. It really shocked me. It's such the worst experience that i have ever had when go shopping! I strongly recommend that the manager here should consider their staff, teach them how to behave politely with customer like what they promised in their interview!|0
Haven’t been to any of these in years, but was curious about shirts. Many of them are displayed all wrinkled and some stuff seems dusty. The staff seems to get ruder with the years. We shouldn’t expect much at these stores though 🤷🏻‍♂️ …|0
Let me preface this by saying that I like H&M but wow this store was something else (and not in a good way). I mean it was the day after Black Friday but this was not a good experience, the store was way too crowded and stock was severely limited. The queue for the changing rooms was incredibly long and so very slow. After trying on the clothes I was considering purchasing I put the ones onto the tried-on clothes rack. Or so I thought. Oh how very wrong I was! I was verbally assaulted by one of the workers about how I had put my clothes in the only place that seemed appropriate but, as it turned out, wasn't quite the right spot. Oh my gosh, this sass that she gave me was wholly inappropriate and ruined the store for me. Everyone else I dealt with at the store was delightful but this worker was terrible. Maybe it was just because it was busy but it was definitely not the correct response to a complete non-issue.|0
Rude hostile cashier. Awful customer service. Not to mention some locations have closed fitting rooms so you have to purchase items and try them at home. The process of buying from h&m is hideous and time consuming.|0
I’m never going to that store ever again . I’m 27 weeks pregnant. I politely and respectfully asked the security guard at the door if I had to wait in the line outside before I could get in ( due the current covid situation ) like everyone else or if had any priority . He said you have no priority and you wait like everybody else ! The was very rude and insensitive and could have said it nicely in a different way . I’m very disgusted by how disrespectful and rude de was|0
Very rude employees. I was waiting for my son today outside the fitting rooms. The shop was crowded and the wait was very long. I am not a young person and suffer from a medical condition so i needed to sit. Found a bench where a young man was already sitting so i sat next to him. A pissed employee came to me and told me that it’s not allowed to sit here. I stood up, said that I was waiting for my son who was in the fitting room and  asked him if there was a place where I could sit; he answered in the rudest way: “this is not a coffee shop and we don’t have places for people to sit”. Is this how you treat your customers? Talking to them rudely and not even providing a chair where someone would sit? Decent stores always provide chairs especially near the fitting rooms. And most importantly they teach their employees how to be polite with customers.|0
The staff was nice...but the call center was mega rude and unhelpful. I asked to have someone call the store to see if the pants I had bought too big since now you can't try stuff on...where available in a size smaller and to put them aside...they flat out refused and told me it was because of covid...but 2 hours before the call center guy had done just that. What a terrible customer service|0
the employee was super rude to me, for checking a jacket. He came at me and start yelling at me that I cannot touch the jackets and he will take it... of course he asked me if I wanted to buy all the items I was holding with my other hand. I really don't know what is going on in terms of training in this store.|0
This store has 3 floors and doesn't even have maternity clothes. You have to order them online.|0
The worst....staff is so rude...if H&M is going to continue like this then i dont think so that it will sustain for long. I have nevr seen a company with such bad customer service... I will nevr buy from hnm again thanks to their rude staff.... Save some bucks and buy from Zara instead...zara is worth it.|0
"Went there to return an item. The cashier wasn't friendly, didn't say anything (except ""Hi"", oh and where's the ""bonjour?"" he said to all previous customers?) nor smiled. Didn't wish me a great day at the end of transaction. He only managed to say a ""thanks"" that I could barely hear after I said ""Merci, bonne journée"". Wow this must be the worst customer service I've ever encountered. PS: Pls note that the fact that I'm asian doesn't mean I can't speak french :)"|0
I was told by the manager that My outfit was inappropriate to shop at the store! And they asked me not to be around kids in the store! So rude!|0
Worst customer experience of my life + Barely any sizes over 2|0
So much stuff I get claustrophobic. Quality is garbage, dyes used on garments are probably toxic for your skin and weird plastic smell (forsure toxic as well). Bye|0
Please update your working hours if you no longer let people in, 20 min before closing time. I experienced this on June 2nd, 2020 06:38 pm|0
store says it closes at 7 on sunday, made the long walk there to find out it closes at 6 and I wanted to try on a dress but a guy who works there was so rude and kept pushing me out of the store saying it was closed|0
Poor quality. Shop has a very small choice of clothes.|0
I asked to borrow a hanger, a hanger, and they said no! Swriously, one plastic hanger and Kevin and his not helpful tattoos lisped no. Seriously, nevver ask to borrow disposible plastic hanger.|0
Bought a sweater there was a hole in it two weeks later also they had incorrect advertising|0
Worst costumer service ever|0
Was literally told by a staff member that I was too fat to shop in a store like this. Yeah thanks for the self-esteem boost.|0
Worst security, manner less, don’t care about customers, really aggressive.|0
The lady on the cash counter was extremely rude…. Worst experience.|0
I try to return what I buried, but they not take it😠 …|0
Passport vaccinal is necessary for entry|0
The staffs were really rude, and very bad customer service!!!|0
Awful experience! Cheap Clothes! Cheap services!|0
Cheap fast fashion shop.|0
Bad customer service I've ever seen|0
Nawww|0
Poor service|0
The cashier is horrible at dealing with costumers|0
Extremely poorly organized store, we waited 20 minutes to checkout because the employees were not able to do their job quickly and did everything but pass as many customers as possible. In addition, towards the end of our wait an employee told the people behind us to go to another checkout and therefore passed in front of us. I do not recommend this branch at all!|0
Super smart to close the men's fitting rooms and overload those upstairs, another big gathering of Nobel Prize winners 🤌|0
Online purchase with delivery never made by swoopin. Catastrophic logistics. No call, no email, impossible to reach swoopin who received and returned the items to H&M. In terms of sustainable development, it is distressing. In short, I found other negative comments on deliveries and swoopin. I confirm. Do not buy online!|0
Completely ridiculous! Stupid and arrogant employees who refuse that I go see my boyfriend in front of his cabin for 2 seconds to help him in his choices! Also refuse that I bring/give him a new size and they only speak to you in English. I understand that they are not the ones who dictate the rules but there is clearly a respectful way to say it! But I also add to whom it may concern that these are ridiculous rules.|0
RUDE SERVICE... The girls in the cabins are really not nice. Plus, I've already been (twice) asked to have my tote bag checked (plus a Garage bag with stuff I just bought from the other shop). The security didn't even apologize to me despite the fact that he took all my stuff out of my tote bag (also my bra in front of all the other customers). The alarm didn't even go off, which he scrutinized my stuff because I look racialized.|0
Brothel store, I go to see a saleswoman to ask where the plus size department is (given the size of the store I thought there was one) she was very cold, not at all friendly and told me that there are none that you have to shop online... Ok super nice not to think about large sizes in stores we are 2022 thin then!!!!|0
Checkout error, and cashier who doesn't even apologize despite asking for verification before paying / very bad service she had the face of a rude person, please choose your cashiers carefully because it affects service at the store, I will never go back to this outlet|0
- Rude workers at the gate during peak business hours - employee who prevents me from seeing my wife try on clothes in the cabins: call security?!! - unilingual English-speaking service at the checkout - forces me to go up myself to take the same garment 2 floors above because the price was not on the one chosen  All this happened in a single visit of 10min, wow!!!|0
The cashiers are just talking. There is a line up of more than 50 people and nothing is progressing!!!! I don't recommend you at all. A very big lack of professionalism in addition she is stupid like their foot|0
Horrible experience. Store 3 floors, only one open fitting room, 30 min wait to try on clothes. endless wait at the checkout too, slow and inefficient employees|0
Nothing.. No service, already it's H&M and moreover the employees despise you.. well|0
I love H&M, but this store is not my favorite Scandinavian brand. The selection of clothes is really limited it's like in a sweatshop and even if you find something the fitting rooms are NEVER open it's scandalous.|0
"No stars. No notice that the fitting rooms close at 7:30 p.m. There are a lot of employees and they have fun chatting rudely with their microphones and we hear very well their comments of ""get out"" when there are 30mins left before closing time. Big lack of management in this particular store ."|0
Employees at the arrogant children's cabins, who don't WANT to work AT ALL: order online you will feel much better!!!|0
Hello light pollution? - it's a bit intense|0
Customer service really sucks Once I went to buy I tried on a jacket that was on sale, the saleswoman spoke to me in anger and she was shouting at me and moreover things on sale you cannot try on and even when you buy them there is no return! But it's crazy And moreover I went another time to buy sandals I saw them online.. there were none in store.. I asked nicely that I make the order at the checkout like at Zara.. she answered me oddly the cashier .. I told her I do not want home delivery because there are neighbors who steal things, she told me it's none of my business! While the sandals if I buy them online it costs 34 dollars with delivery of 8 dollars!! Plus tax the sandals became 50 dollars!! What a scam! And there was a saleswoman, she was yelling at a veiled woman because she was mistaken when she went upstairs!! I prefer that you hire people who give good customer service And I don't know why delivery costs 8 dollars while Zara costs 5 dollars|0
Very disappointed with your customer service. I buy 3 pairs of tights. I take the size large on the advice of a saleswoman who tells me that I can exchange the boxes that are still sealed anyway. I open and use a pair that is a little too big. So I go back to the store to exchange my 2 new boxes for mediums. And the saleswoman refuses because the policy is no return for pantyhose, even with boxes that have never been opened. I feel ripped off and I don't want to shop with you anymore.|0
"I wanted to buy an outfit for 50$ and the only correct size available was on the mannequin, I asked the manager ""Dara"" if he could remove it from the mannequin so that I could buy it and he told me that he had no right. I've never heard of her in my life in a linen store. In my opinion he didn't want to since it was closing time."|0
Before 15 minutes that the store closes an employee kindly tells me that I should go down. I said okay! during this time I was choosing a necklace, after not even 30 seconds another employee comes to me and says excuse me but we are closed can you go down to pay I told him you will close in 15 minutes, right? She answers me with latitude no we are closed and you should go down because we are closing now. But seriously it's really rude.|0
I know it's not easy being a saleswoman in a department store, but that doesn't prevent being polite. A total lack of cordiality I find it despicable to give away (or rather throw away) the bag as one would throw away a trash can (perhaps the French accent bothers him, because the previous client (Quebecer) was treated coldly but correct).|0
I am not talking here about the products or the Goods, but good staff, arrogant and very disrespectful, really to avoid!!!|0
The place is getting colder and colder. Since the renovations, customers have lost sight of the exterior to let them focus on the models in the collection. This gives an anxiety-provoking atmosphere. The collection is still small. And the choice of products has been further reduced. Too bad the little charm that the place had has disappeared.|0
I had the problem concerning the authorization of credit card, since my bank sent me a convocation, in which mentions this store which had asked TWO times on ONE purchase, I know that it happens a few times, so I went there the next day to check what happened, so the waitress was not at all patient and told me that she could not check the receipt I had signed at that time that, which is unbearable it is it gave me the impression that my question on the payment and the authorization of credit irritates him. In short, it's a shop, a brand of cheap clothing, like father such son, customer service is also cheap! We can not expect too much otherwise it's your fault, huh?|0
Rotten customer service. If you are sadomasochists, go there you will be served! You have to come up with the attitude to put those salespeople back in place.|0
Demasiado costoso  Too expensive|0
Worst cashier I've come across in my life. Endless waiting in the fitting rooms, but it's always the same.|0
It's a huge bazaar. Lots of stock of poor quality clothes, with no storage logic, it's very hard to find anything.|0
Sell boxers so tight you can be sure to become sterile in record time.  Non-refundable|0
Apparently plus sizes can't find clothes in H&M stores. Why ?|0
Very unpleasant sellers, a long queue for the cabins and a bit of a mess everywhere|0
Still unable to try. Only trade for sales...|0
Siempre me ha gustado esta tienda pero aquí está saturada, no se ver nada sin recibir empujones  I have always liked this store but here it is saturated, you can't see anything without being pushed|0
rude employees|0
Bad customer service👎|0
It's simple I love H&M|0
Exchange system that dates back to the 1950s.|0
Shop to visit|0
Iiiiiii|0
Great in-store selection and nice staff.  Didn't appreciate not being allowed to try clothes on because the store policy doesn't want customers trying on clothes an hour before they close... It was 7:55 and was told the store wants everyone out by 8:45 pm. I'm from out-of-town, very inconvenient, so I left a slew of items behind (potential revenue).|0
All 3 changing rooms were closed, disappointing. I guess they do it at a certain time but still, could be handled better.. They had a sign in the men's saying to go to 1st and 2nd floor and those were closed also.|0
"I think some of there employees might be in need of client service lessons, and this is why:  I went to the H&M today at 8:15 PM and when I gut there I tried to ask the help of this guy and he just snubbed me, I thought he might be busy so I asked the help of a lady that was working on the jeans section. Honestly, she was friendly, helpful and professional. However couple of the pieces that I picked up didn't fit. So I asked her for help again unfortunately, it was 8:45 and she have shelfs to arrange. so she referred me to another employee (Which was the same guy from earlier) ,and I went with him but he was very rude and suddenly he start dropping words like (We have nothing for you) and (try H&M online ""implying that i am annoying his lordship"") and when I told him where I could find another stores he looked at me up and down and annoyingly direct me to couple other stores.  I returned back the stuff I was planing to buy as I am not about paying money for insults and left the store wandering how the hell this guy was allowed to talk to clients. I mean honestly, that guy attitude was so rude I thought I might own him money or maybe he will give me these clothes out of the kindness of his heart. I think H&M must watch some of there employees attitudes."|0
Fast fashion front runner.  Cheap materials at semi cheap prices.  Really bad for environment since these will not last and end up in garbage.|0
Staff needs more experience in costumer service. Not perfessional & not very helpful. I left 6 articles in store & won't be going to that location anymore|0
Poor customer service. I will never shopping there again. Not too many selections.|0
"The staff here doesn't know anything about return policy of online order. They will tell you ""Vente finale"" when you try to return online order."|0
There is a $6 differences between scarfs in the womens section and mens section. They are of the same size and seemingly made of the same material. This made me sad|0
I went during the holidays, they closed the store before the closing time and the security guard was being very rude about it.|0
The st. Catherine store is so obnoxiously bright. It is literally an eyesore. I cant stand passing by at night, its that bad.|0
35 minutes  to try on clothes is unreasonable.|0
Changing rooms are closed so it's impossible to try anything on|0
Stocks online and over the phone are not accurate|0
Synthetic fabrics made by children sold by late teens. Only works in a pinch.|0
They left the security tags on my clothes =/|0
Not much variety,  Inspite of prime location|0
Black Friday sales were pathetic.|0
Good place|0
Coolest monkey in the jungle|0
Ok|0
Heavily expensive|0
Wrong prices|0
Too crowded|0
Good variety, horrible personals|0
The few sellers available are not pleasant and no fitting rooms?? Also, no men's shirts??|0
There are no more jeans shorts or shorts that make sense from a little stretch. There are sizes XXS or XXL but nothing in between. I want to point out that it's 40 outside right now...|0
Untidy store and unwelcoming staff|0
Very few choices for men.|0
Tidy, few people during COVID. On the other hand, I would have preferred to know that we cannot try on the clothes before moving downtown. In the end, I went shopping elsewhere. Never mind.|0
For real between this h & m and pekin in the rush hour i can't make the diff|0
No es posible que en uno de los lugares más fríos del mundo, no vendan orejeras! 😱  It is not possible that in one of the coldest places in the world, they do not sell earmuffs! 😱|0
No choice of gloves - too bad that's what I was looking for|0
Question of luck 😂 it's the same items that are repeated. same style.|0
Varied and affordable merchandise. Execrable service.|0
too expensive for nothing|0
Unique men's area and in the basement.|0
Poor quality and durability of clothing|0
Poor service. A mess!|0
Corona!  Crown!|0
Beautiful clothes but only poorly educated young sellers (men's section) fitting room closed (why?)|0
When you can't see the Forrest because of too many trees... the store is loaded with amounts and variety of clothing, it's difficult not to feel like all is just a big mess. However, long waiting in case you want to try something and nevertheless, the store is loaded with clients...business must be good.|1
Dissapointing experience. I arrived way before the schedualed closing time. On internet it indicated 9 pm. I was there at 6:40. There was an employee rushing the customer toward the cash registers in an unprofessional way.  Also, there is almost no products in store anymore in the men section. It's seems to get more and more empty almost seems like the store is going to close down.|1
Very large interior and many items yet selection seems limited, fitting rooms are sometimes closed off, and generally chaotic.|1
This is a review for people who want to go there during the covid-19 breakout. They will spray your hands at the entrance but that's about it. The changing rooms are closed but you can return things if they don't fit. I would recommend this place if you're low on stuff to wear in your house, you can grab a 7 dollar t shirt and a similarly priced short. You'll be able to wear the shirt outside for a while before it loses color in the wash. It's not the best place to shop for larger sizes either currently. It's pretty good for what it is, a store to buy cheap clothes. If the changing rooms were open and cleaned after each use like the American Eagle I'd give it a 4.|1
Maybe I'm getting old. It used to be my favorite shop for clothes shopping. But I don't want to buy clothes that I already had to wear in the 80s. It's a good place to shop for right off the catwalk couture. But basics seem to be hard to get here these days.|1
Stylish store with a large selection of clothes for women. Men's section is a bit light and doesn't change much year over year. Prices are more reasonable when they have a special promotions going on. Can usually find something I like with each new season's line.|1
"👍 : Overall good. They are trying to make the ""big city"" style store that has multiple floors and it's overall new and clean.  👎 : One big idiocy of this store is that they made 3 floors for clothes but they made a tiny ass changing room area. The line to the changing room is bigger than the pay lines and goes on for so long on busy days (you can spend more time in line than shopping). Not to mention the line blocks people shopping on that floor so people are pushing and shoving to get through. What idiot designed this?! Make it bigger!! You have so much space just because it isn't a part of the store that will make you money doesn't mean you guys should be cheap and not make bigger changing room areas for people!!"|1
Not the best place to shop for guys, the few things they have are alright. Service is focused on the women's section. If you know exactly what you're getting its good however.|1
The clothes are a great price but all the shirts and different sizes so I'm a large in one type and a medium in another.|1
Clothes great, staff great, the heat though. Unbearable especially as you reach the 3rd floor. It's October. No need to heat the place like it's the middle of winter|1
Great style and price|1
Don't bother if you're not in your 20s and skinny. Be wary of the stitching quality. There can be some good deals, and the clothes are stylish.|1
Their escalators are terribly constructed and very annoying to use. The staff is friendly and the selection is great but everything is piled up and it feels very tight.|1
Nothing special, fast fashion pieces of clothing and always so many people at the same time. There always something for every taste.|1
Very busy, and staff are not super lively, but they get the job done. Anyways clean and a good selection of garments.|1
The line to the changing rooms is way too long. Better make use of their return policy and try clothes at home|1
Great selection, large store but it's way too busy and messy! The staff weren't that great either.|1
Fair prices. Good store. Wish there was more of a men's selection though.|1
It's ok, but far from what it used to be|1
This store comes with a huge variety specially during the sales... but the staffs are quite rude to customers.|1
There is only 1 fitting room is open.|1
Nice collection but long line ups for trying on capacity of trying rooms don't match number of visitors|1
Quite a large location with multiple floors. It is well staffed so it's not usually too messy.|1
Nice selection. They have a kids section on the higher level.|1
Not much attractive or well-designed stuff|1
Despite being a favourite shopping spot for me, the shops in Ste. Catherine street are very chaotic in the way they show merchandise.|1
An okay selection of clothes... Pretty poor quality but still fun to shop.|1
No great deals|1
Not much of choices with good qualities. But the kids section is perfect|1
good fashion, wish they were more ethical in how their products are made and delivered.|1
Good brand product in very cheap price.|1
ambiance  is good but same stuff for very long time|1
Too much merchandise with no fitting rooms on the first floor!!|1
Limited selection on Men's but lots if variety for women or as it seems.|1
Not a lot of good options for men!|1
People who work here should like idk look more alive|1
Where else can you get clothes made by people with ridiculous salaries at an affordable price in the city?|1
Wide range of selection, but the staff weren't approachable|1
Service was 5/10 however they were hesitant to help.|1
Cheap but also not sure of the clothes quality..|1
Sometimes you find beautiful things and sometimes not|1
Someone wiped their bum on the shirt so I got discount|1
Online has better selection.|1
Nice clothes, nice staff.|1
Average hm. Kind of disorganized|1
Only skinny pants for men|1
Things just don't fit right|1
No kids section|1
Cool  clothes|1
As expected. Not much.|1
To many people in the lines|1
Bit crowdy|1
Huge.|1
Nice clothes|1
Great|1
Fine|1
Boring|1
Nice store|1
Chap price|1
It was okay|1
The shirts collection should be improved.|1
There are many cheap and young styles, so I use them occasionally. There are no particularly pretty clothes, but basic cotton polar bodysuits are cheap and the quality is good. And there are many types of jeans and various sizes.|1
Post of the security guard to review .. I went to see him because a man followed me in an insistent way and spoke to me. The guard didn't take my complaint seriously, it's a shame we're surprised after we don't want to talk about it|1
The type of clothing is limited, many are the same but with different colors and patterns. Price a little expensive for some products whose quality is not very good.|1
Store often crowded and long queues at checkout. Quality of clothing that dips over the years, unlike prices that keep rising.|1
There's a good variety of clothes and it's a nice store. Unfortunately the customer service is not good. The lady at the checkout was very rude.|1
Good choice of clothing. Reasonable price for reasonable quality. Service or no service as I didn't see a sales clerk. No one to greet us. Parking on the street with parking meters.  Good choice of clothes. Reasonable price for reasonable quality. Service or lack of service because I have not seen a sales clerk. No one to welcome us. Parking on the street with parking meters.|1
One of my favorite stores... but this branch is very poorly organized!!  To review :  - hygiene and sanitation - have staff on the floor - better manage balances|1
the store is really big, a lot of choice in terms of clothing designs and cuts. only downside size 44 that I never find. According to the cashier, these would be the first sizes to go. sniff|1
Convenient store to buy the essentials. The trick is to go there in the morning and at the beginning of the week. On weekends, you risk losing patience in endless queues and it's downright chaos. Many choices for women but very disappointing for men.|1
Too bad that some selling price is not like the one at the checkout! So more expensive than expected.|1
Unfortunately it is not for wheelchair users! Things cannot be within our reach, we would need superior customer service. Sorry!|1
I like to sit by the lake and dream|1
I like the brand, the customer service especially at the fitting room today terrible|1
It was okay but that day they apparently had a heating problem, it was very very hot to believe that we were in hell, it was unbearable and even the staff suffocated|1
little choice of neutral colors that does not make you want.|1
An endless wait but large space we find everything from this store at a good price of clothes had to|1
For modern clothes and cheap. Do not expect a quality at the top but it does the trick|1
Not bad|1
There is a lack of children's clothing for the over 10s, which is unfortunate.|1
Really a nice store. But the clothes leave something to be desired|1
It lacks a baby and child section for an H&M in the city center, it's a shame|1
Tro d waiting at the cash desks Close early|1
Cara para lo que es la calidad de la ropa y el diseño  Expensive for what is the quality of clothing and design|1
Great, well-functioning chain, oddly served by jaded employees who are uninterested in customers.|1
I really like this brand, but here I found the products really bad|1
H&M classic as found all over the planet. We like.... Or not!|1
Long wait at the cabins, but the stores are well kept|1
The brightness gives me a headache and attacks me. Good choice of clothes.|1
Department store, but it has no underwear|1
A guy who wants to please his girlfriend brings her a storekeeper to this place.|1
If you like H & M it's a nice shop.|1
Compact troop hard to move|1
Nice clothes for thin teens if possible|1
Friday evening, the fitting rooms are to be avoided.|1
Not so many large sizes.|1
Very limited men's section.|1
Too long in the fitting rooms|1
Missing sizes. Weird spoke arrangement|1
Convenient because closes 'late'|1
How are you|1
It all depends on what you are looking for|1
Prices are affordable|1
... ...|1
Good overall|1
okay store|1
Crowded.|1
Always crowded.|1
It’s a good trendy clothing store at affordable prices. Most of the Staffs are friendly. It has good selection of women’s clothing and felt that it has limited options for men. Overall good for affordable prices.|1
Loves to buy my clothes here because it is not too expensive, I wish we had more big size like on their website. And I hope one day we will have more clothing choices because I visited some H&M which has more clothes for men than here.|1
Very convenient since we needed umbrellas & a rain coat for my hubby. He also picked up a great shirt.  Prices very reasonable & staff helpful.|1
If you've been to H&M you will realize that this is yet another H&M location.|1
Only H&M store in downtown Montreal hence very crowdy. Collection and ambience is good, but you have to wait in long queues for the trial room.|1
Nice winter collection. Have plenty of jogging suits and sweat pants and basics .Medium quality .There are sales on certain items. The above review was in winter. I visited recently in spring and they have sweet colorful ready to wear clothes and they give 15% discount on spot upon registering on line|1
Nice store although needs more customer rep!|1
Always a fun store to pick up some trendy pieces. Downside is that at the St. Catherine Street branch the fitting rooms are not available. Very inconvenient when H&M's sizing can be very hard to judge. Yes, you have 30 days to return the item(s) but if you are looking at more than one item in different sizes this can become expensive to get the right size.|1
Men's in the basement, Women and Accessories spread across the other 3 floors. They really have a LOT of stuff. So if you like H&M clothing, this is the place to go.  They have changing rooms on all the floors and wait times are pretty reasonable depending on the time you visit.  I don't really shop at this brand as much as before because I find their cheaper stuff too cheap in terms of quality but this is still a really great store for shoes or cheap accessories.|1
Crowded, the place is ok not a fan of the fashion trend this year !|1
Very good location, easy access. Prices were good. Can't comment on staff except for cashier who was great! He was very personable and efficient. The only reason for the 1 star reduction is there seemed to be too many areas where it was a tight squeeze and hard to move around/past items, but otherwise it was a very good experience.|1
It's a good store.. big one.. to much to choose.|1
It's a great place for shopping and the location is really good. It can be so busy on the weekends.|1
this store has some nice pieces of warm sweaters for the season.  Nice fitting jeans for 25 bucks . Good place to check out. You shop freely no one bugs you while you are shopping.|1
Vibrant collection for shopaholics. Love their collection of joggers and graphic tees. Also, great jackets and accessories. The staff is super polite.|1
Good store, lots of variety and definitely better and more stocked than the other H&M in town (the one closer to Place des Arts). You will find lots of cheap and in-trend items at this store. Most styles are only plain though and single coloured, and nothing too crazy or stand out in the styles offered here.|1
Great selection.|1
This is a HUGE H&M store! I prefer the layout of the Fairview H&M, but this one is pretty good. It's really hard to find things sometimes because you might have to go on a few floors. The service is always so-so. The associates at the cash are generally very distracted and the change-rooms' associates are generally gossiping. I love team spirit in stores, but I'm not sure that's what it is at this particular H&M.|1
I heard a lot about H&M when I was in my country. Because most of their clothing products are manufactured in our country. I am a bit disappointed with the price and quality.|1
Good prices, 3 floors. You can find things for kids, men, women|1
I Found lovely clothes for a great price, but there is always too many people waiting for the fitting rooms.|1
It’s one of the few places on the saint Catherine with wheelchair access, meaning I can actually push a stroller into here and there’s elevators unlike other shops! The only thing this H&M could have would be a maternity and baby section, then it’d be perfect. Especially since H&M is one of the few youth focused retailers that offers a nice maternity selection and really cute baby clothe. Please bring them to this location!  Edited October 2019: thanks for adding a huge baby section🎉 holla at me when you bring maternity and I’ll basically live here.|1
Other than the fact that the staffs looked like they hated their job, the shop itself was good!|1
H & M is a hit or miss store in regards to quality. The quality of the items varies and is inconsistent, some items are decent and some items you can tell just by picking them up is really low quality. You will usually find something in fashion at a low price but you usually pay for what you get.|1
It needs a little more for the men...women have 3 floors practically and it's just some of the same stuff dispersed. Men need a little more on the more useful accessories like hats/coats/some shoes. Oh and more room for rooms...if that makes sense.|1
My fave place to buy good clothing. The only problem I have is the fitting. Since I'm asian, I have problems with the sizes. But, you have to be very keen on checking the items before taking it. Over-all, it is awesome!|1
Very good variety but the staff miss practice.|1
This store has 3 stories so you can shop for quite a few hours in there. The salespeople are SUPER helpful. I think it should be noted because over 3 freaking floors you are bound to never ever find what you are looking for.|1
Great place ! Only one floor for men's clothes but still a lot of choice. Although maybe it's missing some changing rooms since all the times I've been there there were lines for trying on clothes.|1
"They used to play good music here, but now it is kind of blah. There was a weird cover of MGMT's ""Electric Feel"" that was particularly offputting.  The second floor smelt like someone dropped a bottle of perfume up there.  Reasonably priced nice clothes."|1
very large store, three floors.  many options with good price|1
They got so much stuff especially for work clothes. Big store, but hard to find your size and someone that really want to help. Cath is amazing. She took there time with me, helped find what I'm looking for and have more options.|1
Has a plus size section .. couldn't find the little boys section but the girls was everywhere nobody to assist but well stoked|1
Huge store, great price range. They actually carry sizes bigger than an 8. The staff was nice enough. Can ask for much better in a big box chain|1
Awesome store, great products, often buy t-shirts and pants from there and u can find decent tanktops and hoodies too. Can't go wrong but it also depends what ure looking for.|1
Good rotation of cheap clothes every month or so. The waiting lines for trying on clothes can get quite long if you come during the weekend or weekday evenings.|1
I do my regular shopping here, but the annoying part is they don't even know loyal customers, even if a sale is ongoing, the moment you are out of the store, you won't even be able to change not even the size u mistakenly pick , aside that u could get some good stuffs|1
Drop by loads of wonderful clothes 😉 great prices and value …|1
1 Star less because it is so popular that it is difficult to get help mostly on the week end. However the brand has improved their design the past decade and is now at a level of other big names in the industry.|1
While the blinding lights seem rather ostentatious from the outside, this is actually one of the better H&M stores I've been to. The selection available for men's clothing is also quite impressive.|1
Staff is ok, I've been to better stores in other cities, be more friendly and show you love the brand at least|1
A lot of discount available.. all range of products are available .. neatly organized and beautiful set up and decorations.. products are good and new|1
Big shop with a nice collection.  Only down side is that there is always a very long waiting like to try stuff. The price is good.|1
Bast clothing for cheap price. Bought some Clothes mede in Bangladesh and India, I specially prepared clothes made in Bangladesh. Perfect sized and unique dgn.|1
Good deal if you have time to look for stuffs. Line up for trying but worth it if it is a deal. Good value for cloth n accessories|1
Good place to shop for clothes overall but there is a bit of a long wait time if you want to try out the clothes there.|1
More or less same store found in other branch. However the staff makes the difference here. Very helpful and friendly. Constant genuine smile.|1
I found the quality of clothes got better than it was before. Nice store after their renovation.|1
Lot of space and great time walking over there|1
Nice and affordable clothes. Good deals every time I go. Huge variety as well.|1
Although the men section is as small as it gets ( like everywhere else) the store is very nice looking and the employees are very helpful.|1
Convientional H&M guy section is bellow ground but otherwise great!|1
Love to shop in this H&M. But wish they could have Home section in this store. Since it's in DT area.|1
Lots of selection for women, small selection for men. Good prices and decent clothing make this a place to visit if you are in the area.|1
The shop is beautiful, but didn't get any service (since I didn't need one)|1
I wish the cashiers be more friendly!|1
Decent clothes, good service, decent prices. Lovely sales, as well.|1
At least sell's staff leave you alone , they are not on you and push you to by|1
About three floors dedicated to women fashion and one basement with basically nothing for men.|1
Good price but not enough large|1
One of the nicest H&M downtown, although the racks were so overfilled it made the shopping experience frustrating.|1
Great store. Great prices. Sometimes the personnel is a little rude.|1
Fashion forward clothing at affordable prices. Staff could be a bit more inviting|1
Good price, not so quality, but trendy clothes.|1
Lovely shop people. Wider selection than the other downtown location.|1
Long queue at the checkout and fitting rooms|1
Very similar to any other H&M store. If you are visiting from the US, prices are cheaper because of the exchange rate|1
Had no issues with finding what I needed, and the staff was very helpful.|1
Really awesome clothes for kids with a lot of fancy options|1
4 stories, very clean. Didn't have as much as I thought but overall good selection.|1
Your standard HM. As a Swede I felt they had less than I'm used too, but they had what I needed!|1
It was great the staff was very friendly and helpful, some are cute to,  lol|1
Love H&M great prices|1
Affordable prices, but not a whole lot of selection|1
Its clean and ok until there are huge discount and everything looks like  a horror movie|1
Beautiful store. Beware it does get crowded.|1
Good, but small corner for boys 4-10y|1
There always one or other sale going on. Happy! 😊 …|1
The biggest H&M in the Montreal area, very nice store with decent prices.|1

He should have a public restroom like at the Winners store.|1
H&M is in my opinion a clothing store much more for women. The choice of men's clothing is quite limited. But my girlfriend loves going to this store.|1
Gran variedad de diseños muy actuales para todo los gustos, sus precios 😉 muy buenos 👍  Great variety of very current designs for all tastes, their prices 😉 very good 👍|1
Nice place, the prices are really good, I took the opportunity to buy a few pieces|1
A large H&M store can be cluttered, the service is average, there is often a wait at the checkouts. You really have to search to find what you want. There are many many choices (maybe too many) It's definitely not the kind of place where you do your shopping quickly. The quality of the products is not exceptional.|1
Nice expansive store with quite a bit of selection from what I saw from the men's section. On the other hand, I could see that the sizes seem to become smaller and smaller with the years and the higher prices, if I take for example the jackets/hoodies that I have been buying every year for about 7 years.|1
International store whose quality/price ratio is to be taken into consideration. Clothing offered for both women and men as well as a wide range of accessories to dress up your outfits.|1
Prices are good, I returned the products without any problems, I was satisfied with the customer service.|1
Probably the most complete H&M branch in the Montreal area. Trendy clothes for all prices. On the other hand, the European cuts are not necessarily adapted to the face of Quebec. Look for regular cuts that are less narrow.|1
The store has been redone so aesthetically it is at the top. But for me there is too little balance. To overcome this I also go to the other h&m lower on Ste Catherine.|1
Choice, checkout staff always friendly, a little less if you need help on the shelves, good value for money|1
Very large store. Vast choice. You can do good business there. You have to know how to search|1
Great place to buy clothes at more affordable prices, but still of quality. However it is quite busy.|1
The renovations are beautiful! It's always a little mess, but it's H & M, so it's always like that! The second floor for women is great.|1
This season, there is a nice choice of coats and more things exploded, too bad that 'Montréal we are satisfied with the traditional carrottee shirt and black legin with the black and khaki jacket..again.|1
Morally h&m are not the best, on the other hand when you are looking for a basic, they always have some and the cuts are pretty.|1
exercise your feet|1
Big and beautiful store, but still a lot of waiting for fitting rooms|1
Very large store (4 floors) and really beautiful since the renovations|1
It's stylish|1
There is a choice but the prices are left desired|1
It's a bit like a factory, but there's a wide choice for everyone.|1
Great diversity of clothing, well ordered, easy to find, good price|1
Very clean and well placed, but poor quality linen|1
Since the renovation it's better The men's section is in the basement, it's better|1
Good price|1
Clean shop, nice staff, highly recommended, as everywhere at H&M|1
Large choice of clothing and beautiful places on 3 floors|1
There are a lot of clothes, but the ones under 175 are not easy to buy.|1
Lots of cheap and fashionable things. WE love!|1
Large boutique on 4 floors. Nice selection.|1
An H&M neither more nor less, when you've seen one you've seen them all...|1

Ah so disappointed. I ordered online, package came late and i was already on the trip. Just got back, tried everything and its too baggy, so i brought it to the store for a store credit as it was a little passed 30 days. They have all items in stock right now so i did not see a problem. Counter attendant was super nice but her manager was not, after checking that items are not used they tried to scan to return it but smh did not work and manager said that items cannot be returned, then i ask to exchange and its a NO.  I buy h&m very often especially for my kids but now I will choose Zara or GAP which are the same quality brands providing excellent customer service!!!|0
I spoke to a lady on the kids section before I bought an item and she told me that I could return or exchange item that I'm buying for my daughter. When it turns out that the pants I bought was too small for my daughter I tried to return it to the store. Without hearing me out or listening to my story, the clerk just said sorry its final sale. You can't return it. There you go. Without any compassion. Could it be that your staff made a mistake or miscommunicated?! As a brown person dressed in street clothes I felt like I was being judged when I walked in there. I honestly don't care about the money but I felt that it could have been handled a lot better . Better take your business elsewhere.|0
Very poor customer service,  I was trying scarf while my sister was paying, one worker told me you can't take scarf front of mirror,😳😳😳😳  I don't know if I dont try how can I buy , it was rude  I never seen someone said you can't take there 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 …|0
Horrible experience at this store. Was demeaned and insulted by a staff member while trying on clothing. After contacting their customer service department about the incident, they promised some sort of credit, only to ghost me and ignore further emails. Guess this is acceptable to them. I have shopped here for years but will never go back again.|0
Bad customer service!!! I am really disappointed with the service I’ve got from H&M today. I am a royalty member of H&M. Today I wanted to return one item of hundreds items that I bought online from H&M at this place( pacific centre) but since it was just few days past from 30 days they didn’t accept the return. I was thinking with my self that how much I have spent during last past years and how awful customer service I got. I asked the manager to just do the return this time for me since I wasn’t able to return the item which was completely unused from the summer collection and he repeated the policy for me and asked me to call H&M customer service and get the authorization. After spending an hour in that branch and trying to contact “Customer Service” their answer was the same. I am really upset at this time because I have never seen this kind of CS in Vancouver before. Never come back to H&M again!|0
Not enough cashier's, cashier's do not listen to customers and added unnecessary charges.|0
I bought two pair of shorts. Two weeks later, the zipper failed on one. When I tried to return that pair, the manager said, no receipt, no exchange. Shoddy products, lousy return policy, lousy customer service. Never again.|0
It's not worth the score.The customer service is so bad.The staff didn't understand the guidelines and contents of the service, so they spent half an hour, but they couldn't find a good reason. A place where someone who she like  to be a manager speaks cant English|0
The cashier over there are so rude. They do not know anything about costumer service. I went there yesterday and the price was written wrong at one place abd the system was showing different price. When I noticed it, the cashier started arguing with me. I am a nice person and it was my worst experience. I would never visit at this location again.|0
Do not shop at this store. The staff is the most unhelpful of all stores. H&M is already weak when it comes to customers service and quality but this store managed to be the worst one.|0
Employee rushed me out of the change room bad service|0
Really bad customer service. Right at 06:59, we wanted to exit the store. The girl at men's department was closing the shutter gate. We requested if she could open the gate, she straight up refused to open it and told us that we need to exit through Granville St. We then hurried up to female section upstairs.This girl up there was closing the door. We requested if she could open the door. She didn't say a word after this. My boyfriend apologized to her twice but she said nothing at all. At last, we said thankyou and she didn't even respond to that. The worst associate I have ever met in my life. Maybe the employees need to be a little nicer towards customers.|0
Apparently returns aren’t allowed Friday through Sunday which is a nuisance considering their dressing rooms are closed. How as a business can you select days when returns are and aren’t permitted not only is this super inconvenient it’s incredibly bold considering your located in a Monday to Friday business environment of business towers. Do better|0
They won’t let you return things in store that were purchased online, which is a pretty irritating and cheap company policy. Definitely not clear when making a purchase in their website. I don’t normally shop at H&M and this definitely won’t motivate me to do so.|0
Several days ago I purchased a shirt. I was getting ready to go to work and put my new shirt on. What a surprise! The security tag was still on. Oh well, I thought happens, human error. I just went to the store to take it off, so after mere apologies I asked for a discount for the next purchase, as I had to use my time and money to get back to the store. Unfortunately we don't do it here, I heard from the girl at the cash register. She talked to the manager and he confirmed. I returned the shirt, I won't support this company ever again, there lots other options.|0
WORST SERVICE EVER!! I like H&M and their clothing gives you a good bang for your buck. This location is the absolute worst though and I wouldn’t recommend shopping here. Multiple staff members were rude and unhelpful. The store is extremely disorganized and there are clothes everywhere. It seems like a lot of stuff but none of them know what they’re doing. I realize that it’s Covid and that certain stores aren’t allowing people to try on items, it would be helpful if they had signage at the front of the store that let their customers know that. Instead I ended up walking around with a huge bundle of clothes only to be told that change rooms are unavailable. The staff member I spoke to was rude about it.  To make matters worse,  I went back the next day to do some returns after I had gone home and tried everything on. The staff were again rude and unhelpful with the returns. I couldn’t believe the horrible service that I had here. Once again WOULD NOT recommend shopping at this location. You’re better off ordering online, you can’t try on there anyways.|0
Hi, Dear management, just to let you know H n M pacific location has the almost worst staff. their knowledge is far far far away from practical situations. as i m a regular customer of H n M but it doesn't  matter to anyone then I will be doing no shopping from Hn M . thank you for making my day bad. honestly, i want to give zero star to the pacific location in terms of customer service n to the manager.|0
"Pathetic customer service, specially a lady named ""ANNE"" on the front-desk. They behave so rude and talks like it's their own store. Sales person like this are actually spoiling the brand name. Sorry to say, but will never visit this store again (nor I recommend)."|0
This Indian cashier was so rude and impatient with every single word I said…..like if u don’t wanna work as a cashier then go find another job. Stop giving attitudes toward customers😅😅😅 …|0
Terrible experience!!!! The cashier, she was so mean!I Unfortunately I have to say it was my second and the last one I would never ever shop there. I personally work at retail for 10 years, eye contact, greeting it's the most important key at retail.|0
Worst return policies. If Something is torn, not even bother to exchange or return even if customer is  trying to do in within 24 hours. Thank you for a horrible experience Regards, H n M loyal customer.|0
The male cashier was quite rude and completely unprofessional.  My mother requested to get the price for a sweater because she was purchasing a size medium and all the small sizes were tagged as sale items. The cashier would not let her speak and he kept interrupting her stating that there is no sale on the item instead of simply scanning it to get the actual price. The manager I spoke to apologized repeatedly but didn't resolve the price mystery. We had to take matters into our own hands and go to a different cashier and let him scan the item only to find out the damn sweater was on sale. I will not be returning to this store due to lack of service. I don't expect extraordinary service but at least treat your customers like people! Terrible service and terrible management!|0
"Was looking for jeans this evening. Asked the lady if she could help me with jeans. She didn't even make eye contact and said,  ""I'm busy doing something else right now, but I'll be back!."" goes to women's section to hang some clothes, comes back and walks by me completely ignoring me. Zero customer service! Can't wait for Uniqlo to open its stores! had a great experience at their location overseas. Superior products too! Shopping at local Hollister store has been very pleasant!"|0
The cashiers are very bad. One cashier was out of receipt paper, she kept us waiting for 10 mins while she helped other customers from behind on a different register. Very very bad unpleasant experience. Would not recommend this store. No doubt they are going out of business.  Update 1: Then 20 mins later. Still no receipt. Cashier does not know how to print the receipt or cancel the transaction. Still waiting at the cash register for someone to help.  Feels like i am trapped here. They can’t print the receipt or cancel the transaction. Pathetic!  Update 2: after 10 more mins, the cashier disappeared and we are still waiting like objects which don’t exist.|0
Bought a dress shirt in Seattle which was sold to me WITHOUT the tag, I was assured it was fine and I'd be okay to return it if needed. I came by this location today to return the shirt because it gets very easily wrinkly in the bag despite being 'easy-iron'. They refused to return the item because there was no tag on it, even though I was told this would not be an issue... Manager said since she cannot resell, she will not refund. This is unacceptable and I plan on escalating it. Needless to say I will not shop here again...|0
Very MAD! I came all the way to shop at H&M on my night off, spent an hour meticulously looking every item through every section, looking for my size for each of the many items I wanted to try on. At the fitting room I took 7 in and they told me they’d old on to the rest (about 12 items left) and when I came out to try the rest IT WAS ALL GONE! I didn’t even get to try on half of what I had meticulously picked out and looked for my size, face in the racks to reach (I’m short...) .... instead of the relaxing evening I had planned shopping, I came out of there completely MAD , the girls working the cabins barely apologized... at least if they had showed me how sorry they are , I would have felt taking cared of as a customer... but they just stared at me blankly ... Thanks for ruining my shopping evening...|0
Went into this store to exchange/refund a garment that I had bought a few weeks back, but wasn't able to due to by own negligence of losing the receipt. I don't have the lady's name that was at the counter but she must be a manager or supervisor, . After my quite passive aggressive encounter with her about my garment, another (male) H&M employee came up to the counter to ask her to search a garment for a lady he was helping, to see if it was in stock in another size. She said that she wasn't able to do that as they don't have the ability to do that on their system (which I believe is not true) and told the lady to download their new app to check the store inventory on her phone. Now I'm all for apps and new technology but this was a lady who was probably in her late 50s and she didn't want to download the app - fair enough, I'm in my early 30s and I wouldn't want to stand around downloading an app either. The young male employee that was helping this lady suggested that he could use the app on his smart phone to check - YAY A SOLUTION! But no, the woman who had been passive aggressive with me, told him under no circumstances was he to have his phone on the floor and to put his phone away. She then told the woman to head downstairs as the system down there could check the store inventory (huh?!?!)  I would just like to say well done to the young male employee who took out his phone to help the lady, it's not like we're living 20 years ago - everyone has their phones on them at all times now H&M, as long as your employees aren't stood around on the floor instagramming and taking selfies I really think they should be using their personal devices to assist with shoppers questions.  I shop here quite a bit - but I will definitely chose to go to another checkout should this woman be on the desk in future!|0
The renovations is taking a long time. It has been over 1 year. No escalator, forced to use stairs. Store is a mess with reduced selection. Why don't they just close the store and finish renovations quickly, then reopen. Don't make people shop in a construction mess.|0
"I would like to warn anyone who intends on trying anything on at this location. Not only do they talk about how they hate their jobs and ""running for sizes"", they are unfriendly to customers giving them shorts answers and honestly just be impolite. Not to mention they constantly grab things from you when you don't want them  I thought it was maybe just a one time thing, talked to the manager, but when I went back the same thing happened again. Both times I have left extremely upset. And on top of that, I actually buy clothes to try them on at home in order to avoid going back into the fitting room."|0
The staff is very rude and probably the worst experience I’ve had in any retail store. I happen to be walking by the store and liked something so I thought I’d go in. The cashier refused to scan the item and confirm that the item was on sale. When I asked for the manager, another employee suggested that this guy was new and I should give him a break and that I was right and the item was on sale. When we got to the cash register again to buy the item the guy threw the item towards me and walked away. It just shows that these guys aren’t trained for their job and probably should not be working retail. There are plenty of other people that would happily take the job and be miles better than the employees they have working right now. I would not go back to H&M again. A big no from me. Also, they should probably provide their employees with name tags so I could write that guys name on here.|0
Ever since they started with their renos this location has been difficult to shop in. Now they've put in the escalators but there are only fitting rooms on the second floor so it makes it difficult to get sizes, etc. or to carry more than a few things up. I was there this last Thursday and when I asked if someone could check if they had a size the associate rolled her eyes at me. When I got out of the fitting room, I found out that the items that I had put aside with the same girl (that I had picked out as a gift for someone else and was not trying on), had been put back. I didn't have the energy to bother buying anything at that point and probably won't return.|0
"Very disappointing costumer experience, and I have been a number one fan of h&m for years, NOT ANYMORE. They have this posters saying ""buy it now, decide at home..."" and that's what I did, It was my birthday last week so I bought a bunch of stuff and decided to try at home, to see what outfit I could wear and what to keep and what not. I'm the type of person who also, ALWAYS saves every little receipt, no matter how insignificant it is. Weirdly somehow, they through the receipt on the bag, went home never found it again. I've been looking everywhere for my receipt so I can return ONE THING of the bunch of stuff that  bought. I didn't like the item, how it fit, the color, the size. Anyways, went there explained the situation, they said they couldn't do anything. So I was like ok so that ""BUY NOW, DECIDE LATER"" thing will not count? . NO because you don't have a receipt. Yes I know, I'm sorry but this is a brand new Item, right out of the fabric, new collection and everything, In perfect condition, I tried it once! no no no way. so I went on the website, and I saw that YES YOU CAN RETURN YOUR THINGS AS LONG AS THEY ARE IN GOOD CONDITION, and tried to go back and showed on the screen of my phone.. and they said ""that's not in Canada"". Thank you H&M for making my ""BUY NOW DECIDE LATER"" decision totally on the wrong side, making me regret it. and LOST a BIG COSTUMER, who used to buy every single piece of clothing in H&M. NEVER AGAIN. Also, the cashie suggested that I talked to the manager, and the MANAGER WAS VERY RUDE. Managers are suppose to try and help you, HE WAS COCKY, COLD AND RUDE."|0
I asked a girl in the fitting room for a pair of joggers in XS in any color, and she comes back saying they don't have XS in black.  I then reiterated that I would like to try on the joggers in any color that's an XS, and she snarled at me and took off.  To make things worst, I went to pick up two shirts that were left with her before I went into the room, and they were nowhere to be found.  It was the only sizes left in the shirts.  She didn't even look for it when it was clearly her mistake for misplacing it.  I couldn't believe how rude and condescending that encounter was.  Sorry, but I'll spend my money elsewhere now.|0
I wonder if H&M HQ realizes how much money they are loosing on long fitting room and till lines.  At least on three occasions I've attempted to shop here and left after standing in line for too long.  Your cheep cloths are not worth it.... sorry.|0
Rude Indian cashier.. she is talking abt me to the next cashier bcz I paid cash and join a member. So what? I paid full b!tch.|0
Not great. Not a lot of selections.|0
"It's busy, under construction and the worst part is that the change rooms/fitting rooms are closed off by curtains with no indication for the workers to know which rooms are empty - so the workers keep literally ""peeping"" into your room to see if it's in use. They peeked in on me at least three times while I was changing. I won't be going back to this location."|0
Visited this store 10 mins ago. The White lady by the fitting room return section was extremely rude to me for no reason. Never coming back.|0
They get the one star because their prices are ok. Otherwise, this location would get a zero. Customer service does not exist. As a customer you should feel privileged that this place exists. That's the message.|0
Terrible the waitress t    ried her best the pancakes and eggs everything was zzCOLD!! The one star is for the waitress|0
Something is wrong with this store. Staff look upset and tired and not willing to help customers.|0
Looks boring store|0
Truly disappointed! I was at the store because I had to return one item and the cashier was rude and careless!|0
Very poor customer service. I have placed an order almost a month ago and I still haven’t received it. Very terrible service|0
the cashier is so rude. He rolled his eye at me when checking out. will never go back to this place to shop|0
went there and charged me wrong price and the called customer service to help me in this matter, they told me to go back,  i live in chillwack and now have to go back to pacific center for price adjustment.|0
Fast fashion.... bad quality.... but you get what you pay for, right? 🤷🏻 …|0
Baddest customer service especially manager in kids section|0
This place has been under construction so long I just got oil and dirt on my hands from the work.|0

poor business|0
Rude staff|0
No stars if I could. I bought a friend some clothes online for her and her baby. I had it shipped to her house. She didn’t recieve 1 item from the 8 things I ordered. We emailed H&M and they said to do a refund. And I didn’t understand why they couldn’t just ship the missing item.. So then she went to this location and was only exchanging a size and the sales associate was unprofessional, rude and disrespectful. Not only that but they had made the mistake of refunding the items she wanted to EXCHANGE. Not return. They refunded the items and said that there was nothing they could do about it. Overall we both had terrible experiences online and in store. Both situations were not our fault and they did nothing to help. Along with the fact that the sales associates handled it rudely.|0
Unbelievably rude stuff especially the ones working the fitting rooms. Lack of proper management and organization in this store is astonishing.|0
Majority of staff are extremely rude and arrogant. Only one lady there seemed to enjoy her job and know what she was doing. She spoke spanish and was very friendly and accommodating. Such a shame she works in a negative work environment.|0
Some rude and arrogant staff. Yesterday when I went, I got whacked by a door and the employee didn't even apologize, she just looked at me and walked away. Also, don't come here if you support ethical labour and the quality of clothes are worse than shein's.|0
There is a girl with glasses who was extremely rude. When I asked her where I could find some clothes items, she was like 'We don't have them. Go downstairs and ask someone there.', and then, when I was trying some jacket on, she came to me, and said with an annoyed face, 'You shouldn't be trying these things on cause they are on sale.', and there was no notification or sign that we cannot try sale times on. Hey, if look at this review, you know, next time, try to talk more nicely to the customers cause they will understand you or I think you shouldn't be working in customer service.|0
Kinda boring options. Everything is green or beige. Why.|0
I like to check out the different clothing and jewelery options. But everytime I step foot into the store, the customer service is terrible. Staff are rude, make you wait while they are talking to other staff, no one says hi and it appears some staff don't even want to be there. I've stopped shopping there because it's a negative environment.|0
I'm not a big fan of crazy busy places, or shopping. If you don't like to shop I wouldn't recommend this place. The clothes are definitely more for millennials than someone whom is almost 40. However, if you're on a tight budget, and you like the fashion these days, I'm sure you'd like it here. Oh, and they don't really cater to heavier set people very well.|0
What the heck happened to this place?!  and I'm not talking about the renovations which could easily make you feel like you're in one of those escape room mazes, I'm talking about the staff and the lack of training / guidance and general giving a hoot about their job.  Very poorly managed dressing room because the kids working it (no one was over 20) are more interested in talking to each other or being on their phones than actually helping the people in line.  There was at least five people in line and there were over 15, yes that's right FIFTEEN, open fitting rooms. I counted. and there was for counter staff just standing around talking about music on their playlist.  I was going to try and have a discussion with the manager of the store, but she was magically unavailable. (AKA did not want to deal)  This used to be a favourite stop and browse place for me when visiting town but not anymore thanks.|0
Fun fashion. Relatively good value for the dollar. Lacks consistency in sizing.|0
"Review based on my experience shopping men's section on two.  For fast fashion shoppers, have at it—inexpensive, cheap, and trendy. This Downtown Vancouver location can be considered a flagship. When H&M launches their annual designer collaboration this store gets the most stock and sizes. The same can be said about their minor collaborations (e.g., David Beckham; the Weeknd).  The only lines worth considering are their Studio, Trend, and Premium. They're made with better quality, better fabrics, and are more stylish than their regular H&M offering.  From my experience, staff at this location can be rude and ignorant of what goes on. The few times I had questions I was met with ""I don't know"" and a shrug. Employees keeping the store clean tend to be the rudest, for good reason: the store layout is tightly cramped and poorly merchandised. Racks are overstocked, sloppy and unappealing, and the typical H&M customer contributes to the mess. In short, self-serve and expect no real service."|0
The selection of clothing was decent. I was visiting from the U.S. and have only amazing customer service in Canada, with this store being the only exception to the trip. The staff was rude and dismissive to my friend and I.|0
Didn't really have enough selection for Men.  Wasn't able to find anything I liked.|0
I get followed by security everytime I go like they are actually less then 15 feet away from me its disgusting cause I spend good money there and  have never taken anything even never would.|0
Their clothes don't last aswell are not the best quality. Good for cheap options seasonally.|0
Wouldn't accept a return at all even though I never once even took the product out of the package. Hugely wasteful.|0
The one in London much better this one as no punch to it same old same old they posted I could fine a kimono did not find one|0
Horrible YOU CAN'T TRY ANYTHING OFF THEIR CLOTHES..YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUY THEM TO BE ABLE TO TRY THEM AND RETURN THEM FOR A BIG OR SMALLER SIZE OR WHATEVER 🤨🙁🤫🤒☹ …|0
Tried to exchange size three times, was told more would be shipped, then told me they did not know if that would happen, called to have item in size desired put on hold, got there to pick up, wrong item presented, turns out wrong tag put on item, gave up, returned original item, very disappointed .|0
Cheap clothes that you can wear it twice but once its washed, it's done.|0
Yup it's a store selling cheap clothed|0
Not a place I would go for bargain necessarily.|0
Fauste is very unfriendly|0
It is not bad,not good😉 …|0
Meh|0
Bad|0
It’s an H&M, so we pretty much all know what to expect. That being said, it’s not very accessible for someone who’s going around with a cane, wheelchair, etc. That’s not me, but I’ve seen quite a few have to turn out to the entrance elevator to go to another level as they can’t take the escalator.|1
Was not so good have less collection for mens wear and more for women's if you are a girl than you can visit but as a men a suggest you to don't waste your precious time|1
"I normally have a good experience at this location, but yesterday was far from pleasant. I was returning a shirt and asked if they could check another store for a smaller size of something else. As I looked for the receipt the girl told me ""I can't return it without the receipt"", after I had just finished telling her I need to find it.. She looked at me impatiently, and the male clerk called to check the other item for me. They told me to stand to the side and he served other customers as he called 2 other locations (meanwhile acting massively annoyed). He proceeded to yell through the plastic window covering, ""do you want the Small on hold, I need to tell them now otherwise I can't do it"". He was asking if I wanted to hold a Small, when I had asked for an XS. He kept getting aggravated with me and making me stressed out and acting like it was a large inconvenience to make a small request. Let's just say, I'm never going to ask for anything there again - at least not to those two people.I left super stressed and embarrassed from the whole thing. Plus a couple customers looked at me annoyed as he served them and yelled at me at the same time. The three stars are for the two nice people who helped me put something on hold earlier in the day. I get we're living in slightly strange times, but no need to treat people like that. If you don't like your job, it's not our fault."|1
Good store with decent selection.|1
Not as big as I thought but well stocked great staff and easy to get around|1
I take my daughters there and security guy follows us around every time. We just ignore him nowadays and focus on the shopping experience. Decent selection of up to date clothing and excellent seasonal sales.|1
The location is not good to take your car especially at rush hours, that’s so difficult to find a parking lot. Although the staff are polite, you can’t find them in the store!!! Also, I bought an overcoat there that it was forgotten to remove its security tag. Be careful about it, it happened several times. The store is nice and big enough to get satisfy with up to date deals.|1
The new location is really nice, they have better size runs but the staff is just horrible. Can't run the change rooms to save their lives and seem to be overwhelmed with the smallest task.  Don't even think about asking them for a size because it's not coming. The cashiers on the other hand are lovely.|1
Newly refurbished Pacific Centre location. My first visit since their reopening and the new look is really sharp. Very bright and welcoming.  That's the positive part of my impression.  But my opinion of the merchandise - in men's only, as I didn't look at other departments was a little disappointing. They have all their staples in stock like the t-shirts and long sleeve dress shirts which was great...and in ALL SIZES which was a first for me. (KEEP DOING THAT, K?) But that's kind of where ended for me So much of the other merchandise was really.....boring. plain. Or unusual styles and not good unusual. As I was shopping with a buddy on this trip we both felt like H&M is almost styling themselves to be a new LeChateau...and look how that worked out. They've changed direction a bit and in the process have lost some of the essence of what made them successful . I'm not sure if they know who their customer is at the moment. BUT, This is just one small moment in time with a lot happening to make operating a business incredibly difficult. So I will keep an open mind, let this slide and chalk it up to Covid and major renos throwing a curveball. It's ok to make a mistake. So I guess time will tell over the next few seasons.|1
great selection and i’ve been loving the fall selection! but unfortunately the change room staff are just god awful and really affected my experience here. super unhelpful and just loudly talk amongst themselves even when customers are present! very unprofessional! barely even got eye contact when i approached the change room counter. despite this however the cashier staff are great and super friendly!|1
This place is really crowded and the lighting in the dressing rooms is horrible. However, they have a great selection, including maternity and children's clothes. They also have a textile recycling drop box, where you get a $10 voucher towards your next visit.|1
Layout is poor and some of the stock for male clothing is lacking and not taken care of properly. It is H&M so I was not expecting much. The redeeming part is the sales and promotion, you can get some decent clothing for REALLY REALLY low prices.|1
This location seems to have been under renovation forever. It set up as well as it can be however its 30 degrees today and feels the same inside the store.  The clothing is great at an affordable price point!|1
Currently undergoing renovations and the store is literally half of what it was... Poor selection. Staff is helpful but the chance room situation isn't very good. Also, they nearly dont have enough mirrors around the store - this is a big miss.|1
Pretty bad selection for tops & basically nothing in the underwear and pj section. Staff were nice though!|1
Stuff not sorted very well. Too many fits in the same color get confusing. Shopping should be simpler|1
The clothes are nice, but the customer service needs much improvement.|1
One of the few stores that offers a selection of work and play clothing. Sizes are great and they fit regular people|1
No I don't wanna take out my phone camera and become a member!|1
Price are little bit high|1
Smaller the other H&M's but it is undergoing renos so I know great things are ahead for them|1
The prices are very reasonable and the store had a good selection of clothes and acessories...........|1
Good prices always if need to do a return,fairly simple.|1
Always crowded with very less help on the floor. They should work on to hire more assistants.|1
Google its H&M they are all the same. No need for reviews|1
Looked like a whirlwind had just passed through...disorganized and messy. The plus was the line up was little (early afternoon).|1
Mens Selection and styles deeply diminished.|1
A bit limited choice but good for essentials.|1
New store in doentown is smaller... Clothing selections are vary.|1
Sizes are way different than most stores|1
"A huge 2 levels store. However, I haven't seen any ""sales"" section..."|1
Helped me out but could use more selection|1
Cheap quality, but great style|1
Under renovations so was very crowded|1
Need eskalater too ladies.OK.|1
Can always find something.|1
Customer service hit and miss|1
Decent|1
nice clothes|1
Crowded, narrow|1
Average H&M|1
Always good for your basics|1
For the price, the clothes are getting worse|1
Amazing selection of men’s tshirts they are available in various body types and fitting styles. So that in itself is a win + the good pricing  They also have a nice selection of jeans, jackets, formal wear etc.  Good place for everyone to find somethjng they can wear|1
One of the best clothing store but the need to focus on men stuff as well.|1
Got here what I needed...always on sale items which is nice, got a cotton Tees here for 6.99 perfect for summer|1
It’s a spacious store with lots of clothing options, and great changing rooms with nice light and mirrors. There is no line ups to change because they have so many change rooms available. Only downside is although there is a lot of clothing in the store, I found there wasn’t a lot of sizing options when it came to pants. I also found parking to be a bit tricky, but that’s more to do with Vancouver.|1
I like how they are starting to carry a wider variety of sizes but it's only for a few items and most are not in store. I would go here more often if they had a plus size section or more extended sizes in store (including different body types not just plus size)|1
Store clean, busyish but ppl spread out.  Little girl clothes sooo reasonable.  No so much preschool boy or 4-6 sizes.  Selection tiny for boys.  Prices vary a lot.  Some great sale deals but choices small.|1
There is big and peace place for shopping.I bought 2 Pants in sales.|1
There's some clothes with good price for me|1
H&M used to be an affordable fast fashion store with trendy clothes. They now sell $60 sweaters and $100 dresses, but their quality has not improved. Getting harder to find good clothes here. I do love their kids section and this location has a great selection.|1
Really cheap clothing. Staff are friendly and helpful.  If you're on the thin side, they've got really good options for men. Men's tends to be more expensive than women's, but it's still a steal.  I always come back for basic wardrobe staples.|1
H&M reopened 2 weeks ago. But there's an unwritten rule about trying your jacket or coat on: you cannot put the clothes back on the rack due to fear of Covid-19. So don't try your clothes, buy it & try it at home & if they don't fit then return them. H&M will put these clothes away for 24 hrs before putting them back on the racks.|1
the clothes are worth it , i dont think you ll get the best fitting wise , otherwise clothes are good . staff is friendly, they have the ladies and men sections on different floors , sales usually going on , reasonable prices.|1
Large store, very organized|1
There's usually a long line for the changing rooms on the ground floor; go to the second floor if you don't want to wait. Women with EUR36 sized feet- don't bother going near the shoes, they're too big. H&M no longer carries activewear. Try Old Navy instead.|1
Decent selection of low priced stuff for cheap bums like me.|1
I have usually only passed by, but this time i actually went in. They're clothes were nice and not too cheap quality|1
Ithis is a two story location with stairs up (I think there's also a service elevator for those whom have accessibility difficulties). They are currently remodeling the location so it's a chaotic. You can access 8t by going into Pacific center. Walk north from artizia passed the Bose speaker store and it'll be on your right.|1
Like the material and style. Usually I get my shirts and t-shirts from here, but they run out of large sizes too fast. Will definitely shop there for summer|1
My best friend girlfriend found.a nice bag in 15mins... good experience,  a lot of choices|1
This store is so big and so clean. Just love it.|1
Great sakes associates, one of which said I would,get 10% off my purchase if I was a member ur you had I WiFi connection si I missed out on the discount and my purchase was I er $60...|1
The quality of clothes isn’t the best, but then again it’s quite cheap priced so I guess you get what you pay for.|1
It's still fun...even with the imposed corona virus restrictions...YAY...to the former...yawwwnnn to the feeling of being imprisoned in places we're not accustomed to being imprisoned...|1
Fantastic store. Hard to get staff to help with all the traffic in store but its a pretty busy store. Affordable clothing and trendy styles.|1
Very nice if you like H&M. Very big. İt also has discounted products.|1
Typical H&M. It is quite big and has a lot of choice. The cashier who served me was not nice though, he looked mad!|1
This is right beside my work. They always have some nice things and always really great price. Staff is nice too.|1
The price is good but the shirts sizes are different although it has the same sticker on the shirts .|1
They've done some renovation (and still in the process of renovating) so the men's section is very very small, thus their products are not as plentiful bas it used to be.|1
Good selection of clothes but this store is currently under renovations so its all a bit squashed together.|1
Great selection|1
Very high end H&M|1
Big store but no one even acknowledged you in the store|1
Renovations underway so store is crammed and changing room busy. Nice stock in though.|1
Great place to shop. Fit into bugdet. Great quality clothing|1
Low prices and modern, trendy clothes. Only negative is long wait for a cashier|1
Decent prices and friendly staff, store is usually busy .|1
Good in price and u get extra discount if you are a virgin mobile user.|1

Crazy clothing store!  Some nice stuff for the wife and it seems reasonably priced too.|1
Professional staff but highly overpriced|1
convenient location for shopping and great affordable prices for clothing.|1
I come here whenever I'm in the area. The wait lines for the fitting rooms kind of suck but the staff are friendly enough|1

It's always super busy and there is a HUGE line for a fitting room.|1
typical H&M, friendly staff, often sold out of the usual sizes tho|1
Nice store, but current designs are bummy|1

Pretty basic and the way they put clothes was by color.|1
Nice selection and prices for men's clothing!|1
Mucha variedad y estilos de ropa para dama y caballero a buen precio. Además siempre tienen ofertas  Lots of variety and styles of clothing for women and men at a good price. They also always have offers|1

Wide range of excellently priced clothing|1
Good price|1
Good and varied clothes|1
Lo mismo que en otros lugares  same as elsewhere|1
Great , i  enjoy the place  and this location here at PC MALL.   Its huge it has 3 lavels.   selection is good . Went shopping on boxing day late afternoon  thanks to gift card  .  H&M reminds me of a mix of  old navy meets shein lol.   Staff are helpful and nice . It was hectic on boxing day  crowds everywhere  .  This location does have plus size clothing  up to a XXL & 18 size..... yeah it could  be better selection  for plus size like higher sizes and quantity but better then nothing.  They have tons of  XS & S  sizes and anywere else in between with good  verity .  Got a  kids section .   Its got lots of  other stuff like jewelry and phone cases, etc .    Tons of clothes etc for whatever the occasions and reasons  of wearing  .  Its next to public transportation this store  location  at this mall  and central DT location too .  The prices are reasonable probably the most affordable place in this entire mall for every budget  ❤|1
It's a great place, it's definitely budget friendly. Some things are a bit more pricey. But you get good quality for the most part. The fit and finish is usually good. We love going there for fun clothes. Definitely worth checking out|1
Found exactly what I was looking for, at a good price. If you have the app, you can get some discount - which is always worth getting. Staff helped me set up the app, so I could take advantage of the discount ...... now that's looking out for the best interest of your customer.|1
Good for men's clothing, missing variety in the type of men's wear though. Will mostly just be a great source for the entire colour spectrum of t-shirts, shorts, and sweats. Clean and employees are very kind and helpful!|1
Today, I just visited a small briefly. I will say I am from Southern California and this is very different line of clothing much more classy. The store upstairs and downstairs is very nice and I definitely want to go back before I leave Vancouver.|1
Undoubtedly H&M is one of the most prolific market, supplying apparels with reasonable prices & gourmet design.|1
Good quality and affordable prices for woman man kids for summer or winter and even faction jewelery (not gold=gold filled or vermeil ) all you can find here easy access through the store for wheelchairs and access to free parking lot about couple minutes walking to bus station or sky train|1
I like shopping here.  They have a good selection of clothing at a reasonable price. There are 2 floors of shopping. The ladies upstairs and the men's downstairs. The staff is friendly and helpful|1
Awesome customer service at this location. I bought a shirt super cheap but the cashier still told me how to care for it in the wash to extend it's life. I love it|1
I love this H&M! Always a great selection and multiple levels. Right by the Granville and Waterfront skytrain stations.|1
It's the best place for clothes. The prices were reasonable and also they are on sale too.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗 …|1
"My friend and I went there yesterday, and an employee named Sam at the store was really helpful. My friend had a ""brilliant"" idea of paying for her stuff in coins. It was full of 5, 10, 25 cent coins. I felt really bad that Sam had to count them all, but he kept on saying it's okay/don't worry with a smile on his face. Wherever you are, Sam, you're the MVP of the week. We'll never forget your good deeds from that day, and I hope that your manager read this (because you deserve a pat in the back)."|1
I shop here all the time - very fashion forward, great prices, Tip - wait for sales, and buy off season for the next season. I picked up a sweater for $14.00 and a nice faux snakeskin dress for $39.00|1
Great layout, well organized and well stocked. Love this place for it's basics and on trend items. The quality has big range and you get what you pay for so don't buy their cheapest items and you should be happy.|1
Last week, their employee named AVNEET was super friendly and nice to help me find a jacket size - in stock & on the floor, that I desperately needed. She went to each and every section of the store Her customer service was by - far the best that I've seen (or even expected) in any H&M locations I've been to.  She went above & beyond to help me out and that made my day.  I really hope her management sees this because she definitely deserves a pat in the back and possibly a raise :)|1
I have been shopping at H&M Granville since coming to Vancouver a few years ago and have always been happy with my purchases and all the employees for the help they give me. Today, my purchases were cashed out by Avneet. Apparently, she is a new employee -- it's her first day working after her training! She is already such a pro! Very professional; informative and an affable young woman! Congratulations on hiring another great person to represent your company!|1
Came to this H&M today to shop for my kid’s clothes! Avneet in the children section was such a great help. She helped me finding the right sizes saving me soo much time and energy! All the stars are for her awesome service! It’s services like this that makes me want to come to this location again!|1
Yesterday, their employee named HARLEEN was super friendly and nice to help me find a size- in stock & on the floor, that I desperately needed. Her customer service was by-far the best that I've seen (or even expected) in any H&M locations I've been to. She went above & beyond to help me out and that made my day. I really hope her management sees this because she definitely deserves a pat in the back and possibly a raise :)|1
Great experience great options. A very clean well run store|1
This store has more selection than most! Great range of sizes and no hate when o went to the lower fitting rooms when trying on mens clothes. Very inclusive!|1
Amazing service! The store manager was nice and organized.  She called another cashier at the counter when it got crowded.  The staff was courteous and friendly!  They have organized everything very well.  Men's section has all the collections for men and similarly women's section has all the collections for women.  I strongly recommend the store for your shopping.|1
Avneet was amazing today! I was needing lots of help sorting out clothes for my kids, and she was great! She also showed me how to find my membership number and the 3 for 2 deal!|1
Big store of 3 floors with beautiful clothes for women (including maternity clothes), men, children and babies. They have a good costumers service. The prices are reasonable.  Busy store with lots of people.  The prices for babies clothes are expensive.|1
This store has huge collection of clothes and everytime i go there to shop and find great stuff.The staff memebers are great to help amd gessia helped me with great purchase today..Hats off to all the members and keep the good work|1
My kids loved shopping here|1
Items at this store are much more affordable and at this location there are enough sizes too. Loved the customer service for returns|1
I like this place. It is affordable and the staff help out with a smile. For the one at the Pacific Centre, the renovations are still on. The fitting rooms are upstairs so one has to climb stairs to get to them. A tad inconvenient I think. However, the options are huge and the variety makes it worth it. I am not sure how someone with physical challenges can manage this. Work in progress I guess. Check out the summer clothes. Love the shorts and tops.😀|1
I had problem with my online account and I couldn’t log in, at H&M pacific centre I asked a girls who is name is shalana. She was really nice, friendly and patient. Thanks 🙏 …|1
2 floors Busy all the time Is located in the mall.  Well worth the wait. .  Professional staff  Friendly service  Wait times are high on weekends.  $$$ moderate to expensive look for sales.  Customers are all treated professionally and in a timely manner .|1
Good location, within walking distance of lots of stores|1
Has latest trending men's clothing at reasonable prices. Plus it's a block from my place, ha. Great place to get last min out fit.|1
Reasonable price and we'll organized. Good fabric quality|1
2 floors lots of deals . $$$ easy to find everything . well laid out dressing rooms. Should offer a basket to put potential clothes in so you can browse longer|1
This tore on Pacific Centre is undergoing remodeling right now so the second floor of the women section is a bit messy. But it's a big store. The items are always neat and tidy. Easy to find sizes|1
3 levels of shopping. Love this store|1
Really good collection. Excellent value for money. Quality is good too. I personally prefer shopping for clothes from this place most of the time.|1
Good quality for low price, kind customer service|1
I meet AVNEET hereinfront if cashier. she is really nice and doing her job very well.|1
This is one of the biggest h&ms I've seen, it's clean, big, with friendly service and a variety of clothes that won't kill the wallet.|1
H&M has long been a go to place|1
This is a great store for picking up some trendy pieces at a good price point. They have a great variety of clothing styles and some great accessories in their jewelry section.|1
Such a wonderful experience. Avneet was especially nice and helpful. She made my day!|1
Like the styles in this store. Right now big sale 50 60 70% all items. Don't know if they are closing down, but right now Great Store|1
If one is looking for something from H&M, this is the place. Not too crowded. People working there are too nice .|1
Very cool|1
this is the shop that dressed me for the next season. Something's working right..... Will be back for more soon  .|1
Nice shopping experience in H&M! Thanks Avneet for your kind help.|1
3 floors !  you can always find some good deals here|1
Thank you SA 18106670 for your help and patience in my multi item return and purchase and coupon using transaction! He was great|1

My experience there was amazin, because I saw a Mexican famous buying there and I like the clothes and the price|1
I always go here whenever I'm in Vancouver. New deals every day. Found almost all of my favorite shirts and pants here!|1
