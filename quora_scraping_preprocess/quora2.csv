There’s good and bad. Fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara allow poorer folk to stay up to date with trends without spending so much money. People like me can’t pick up a new Rick Owens every fashion season. Because they’re not that expensive, you can easily grab a whole new wardrobe every season if you so wanted to. It also means you can use the rest of that dosh for some good statement pieces. There’s plenty of bad, though. The quality from H&M products is awful - they aren’t meant to be worn for more than one season unless they’re basics like shirts. Certain pieces, particularly footwear, fall apart super easily and destroy your feet. The culture of throwing out so much clothing is environmentally destructive. Fast fashion (although Zara is much more guilty of this) is also pretty much just about copying directly from designers as closely as legally possible, although you can argue that this is how all fashion works anyway. Finally, fast fashion does not create a culture where people actually place value in their clothing. I find it much better to have good quality, upper-middle fashion (if not full-on high fashion pieces) that look great, feel great and last forever. They stay with you and you become more particular about picking out clothes - you’ll avoid impulse buying things just because and you’ll learn to only get clothes that are worth it on you. It’s far better for crafting your own individual style when you have that kind of mindset. When it’s for simple basics then go ahead, do it. I buy plenty of H&M and Zara myself because I’m a poor fuck. However, when it comes to the statement pieces, clothes that actually need to last and things that generally matter to my look more (outerwear, jackets, footwear), I stay the fuck away. I mean, people always seem to forget that there are many, many places where you can buy second-hand clothes for cheap. If money is the problem I say that’s what you should do instead.
I love the brand. It’s one of the places I have been shopping for most of my wardrobe. I make minimum wage and go to college so I don’t have much to spend. I have tried thrifting, but since I’m an XS/0 it’s hard to find clothes that are in my size while I’m there. As long as I wash my H&M clothes on cold and low dry them, they have lasted for many years. I usually buy minimalist pieces rather than the flashy/trendy statement shirts unless they collaborated with an artist/show I like. Even then, my pieces from 2 years ago are still relevant in style today
So today, my dad decided to take me for shopping as my birthday's almost knocking on my door! As we were window shopping in Westend Mall, I decided to check out the H&M store for the first time. I've never really been fond of fancy clothes and always end up buying boy's t shirts wherever I go and then when I've to go to a function, I cannot just find a suitable outfit to wear. Yeah, that's me! :P H&M as I checked the women's section stores more formal clothes than casual ones (I'm talking about the Westend Mall outlet). There were full sleeved shirts and blazers of numerous designs. I wanted something casual, to wear on my birthday and hence, finally ended up scanning the casual section of the store. Let me tell you, I'm not lean and lanky. When you're a foodie, you cannot help it though. Half the clothings in the casual & trendy section were either crop tops or so short that it would just hang till the edge of my hip. I raise one hand, and my bare stomach would be visible. Finally, after a thorough search, found 2 very decent looking tops which fortunately, fit me perfectly. Checked the price tags and found it to be extremely cheap as there's this 70% discount going on currently which didn't make me think twice and buy both of them. I got two 2299/— tops for only 450/— each. So yes, if you're looking for pocket friendly clothes to wear, then the store is for you. I didn't find anything odd with the clothing quality unlike the writers who've posted their views here. The quality is really good and I never wear anything that's not comfy. But here, I found the material to be really soothing and very comfy.
I absolutely love H&M. Their clothing is trendy but timeless. I have clothes from them that I bought years ago and still wear today.
A fast fashion brand having stores everywhere and they tempt you to buy their monthly if not weekly Fashion/Trend crap. What do I think of them.. they are one brand of stores who found their niche among upper middle class people who would buy a or more pair(s) of trendy clothes every 2–3 months and eventually throw the old ones to make the space for new ones… “Affordable Fashion” is second thought that comes to my mind. I walk in these stores almost every weekend and after the initial impulsive purchases that I made finding the clothing to be affordable, I am no longer tempted or buy these on i Continue Reading
H&M’s quality are getting from bad to worse. Fabrics are getting thinner.. Design wise, i think they are alright. Some of the better quality ones like the Conscious Brand are higher in price. I prefer Zara to H&M.. Zara’s design and quality are much better..
It is a trendy brand, I’ve worn their stuff in the past and would probably shop there again. If i was looking for the specific style. I’ve had a sweater of theirs for 4 years and finally wore a hole under the arm.

so i recently went to h&m for the first time & that too for buying my elder sister's clothes since her birthday was soon, i am a very picky person in terms of clothing so i can't really wear clothes that aren't comfortable to me. h&m always seemed like a fancy brand to me and it is…but the quality of the clothes are good too. i hate wearing full sleeves clothes (yeah i know that's weird but i can't help it) and thus i never bought a hoodie for myself, but when i saw a stranger things x h&m hoodie, i kept telling my sister about it since well i'm a huge stranger things fan. i bought it before l Continue Reading

H&M or Hennes & Mauritz is a multinational company based in Sweden. It deals in fast-fashion for men, women, children and teenagers. It was established in 1947. H&M is the second largest clothing retailer in the world after Zara. H&M believes in sustainable fashion for everyone. Do you know that ‘Hennes’ in H&M stands for ‘Hers’ in Swedish? When H&M started out it was only selling clothes exclusively for women. In 1968 Hennes acquired a stockholm based apparel retailer Mauritz Widforss which led to inclusion of men’s apparel. That was the time when Hennes changed its name to Hennes and Mauritz Continue Reading
The production of the garments are outsourced to companies in countries where labor laws aren't strict or well developed. Many employees in those factories are severely underpaid and work in risky conditions, ensuring that the price you pay stays low. H&M made a statement a few years back stating that they will be working on improving employee conditions and wages in those factories but as they don't own the factories, we'll see how that develops. The materials that go into the garments also aren't high quality. Being fast fashion, the garments are made as quick as possible so they can be sold Continue Reading
