4 months ago|secil canbay|I realized why I never shop from this brand again. I pass by because I need urgently to buy simple t-shirt.  I‚Äôve been waiting on the line for 20 minutes although there is no one in front of me because they‚Äôre lack of stuff. Well I lost 30 mins and my mood. Pay 5$ more go to another store|1
9 months ago|Anya|Nice store however their changing room policy is ridiculous. I waited in line which was quite long, but understandable it's the weekend. There is a 7 item limit and I had 12. I split them in half to stay within the limit. However when I wanted to try the second half of my outfits I was told that I need to redo the line. It's a first time I ever hear that in a store. I already waited in line and only needed a few more minutes to try the rest of my clothes. Overall it ruined the visit because I wasn't able to try the rest of my items|1

8 months ago|Wajid Rafique|Awful experience with the store employees, absolutely nonprofessional, lack customer service etiquettes. A store employee started chasing my family right from the time we entered the kids area. She would come and instruct us not to do this or that and later misguided about the changing room. I argued about her behavior ansmd she called her supervisor and this guy was worse than her. He asked me to arrange the clothes that we tried which was against the customer service rules. Both the supervisor and the employee made sure that i don't come to  H&M again. I wrote a complain but no reesponse yet. I would recommend h&m to teach ethics to your employees.|1

10 months ago|Arpad Me|Nice store, awful service. Tried to exchange my 5yr old granddaughter's shoes I bought the day before which had a manufacturing defect. (The inside sole in the left shoe was bend and glued in half creating a bump which wasn't visible when I bought it.) When the two girls at service desk  refused the exchange I asked for the supervisor (refused to identify herself) who told me that the shoes didn't look brand new. The next day I went to H&M Rockland branch where everything was settled in 5 minutes.|1

9 months ago|Asefeh Hasani|I had the worst experience of shopping in this store of H&M yesterday. I forgot my mask and just covered my face, then went to the cashier to ask if they can give me a mask, they told me No. Then I went towards the exit door, looking at items, while I was still covering my face, I saw the cashier came to me and literally throw me out of the store in a very disrespectful way. His behaviour to me was super offensive and really disrespectful. The point is that mask obligation will be removed from the next week in Quebec and it has been removed last month in Ontario. I will not comeback to this store again.|1
a year ago|Dennis van Opstal|Would give a 0 if possible, nothing wrong with the store or the merchandise but what a rude staff! Manager decided to close down the fitting rooms one day before Christmas to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù his staff while rest of shop was heaving with shoppers, anyway, manager is the most disrespectful and hate filled human being I had to lay my eyes on. But he didn‚Äôt ruin Christmas for me man! Love conquers all!|1

I strongly recommend that the manager here should consider their staff, teach them how to behave politely with customer like what they promised in their interview!|1

7 years ago|Andrew Clark|Let me preface this by saying that I like H&M but wow this store was something else (and not in a good way). I mean it was the day after Black Friday but this was not a good experience, the store was way too crowded and stock was severely limited. The queue for the changing rooms was incredibly long and so very slow. After trying on the clothes I was considering purchasing I put the ones onto the tried-on clothes rack. Or so I thought. Oh how very wrong I was! I was verbally assaulted by one of the workers about how I had put my clothes in the only place that seemed appropriate but, as it turned out, wasn't quite the right spot. Oh my gosh, this sass that she gave me was wholly inappropriate and ruined the store for me. Everyone else I dealt with at the store was delightful but this worker was terrible. Maybe it was just because it was busy but it was definitely not the correct response to a complete non-issue.|1

4 years ago|Sherine Nader|Very rude employees. I was waiting for my son today outside the fitting rooms. The shop was crowded and the wait was very long. I am not a young person and suffer from a medical condition so i needed to sit. Found a bench where a young man was already sitting so i sat next to him. A pissed employee came to me and told me that it‚Äôs not allowed to sit here. I stood up, said that I was waiting for my son who was in the fitting room and  asked him if there was a place where I could sit; he answered in the rudest way: ‚Äúthis is not a coffee shop and we don‚Äôt have places for people to sit‚Äù. Is this how you treat your customers? Talking to them rudely and not even providing a chair where someone would sit? Decent stores always provide chairs especially near the fitting rooms. And most importantly they teach their employees how to be polite with customers.|1
2 years ago|Barbara Kraemer|The staff was nice...but the call center was mega rude and unhelpful. I asked to have someone call the store to see if the pants I had bought too big since now you can't try stuff on...where available in a size smaller and to put them aside...they flat out refused and told me it was because of covid...but 2 hours before the call center guy had done just that. What a terrible customer service|1

4 years ago|Jade H|"Went there to return an item. The cashier wasn't friendly, didn't say anything (except ""Hi"", oh and where's the ""bonjour?"" he said to all previous customers?) nor smiled. Didn't wish me a great day at the end of transaction. He only managed to say a ""thanks"" that I could barely hear after I said ""Merci, bonne journ√©e"". Wow this must be the worst customer service I've ever encountered. PS: Pls note that the fact that I'm asian doesn't mean I can't speak french :)"|1

In addition, towards the end of our wait an employee told the people behind us to go to another checkout and therefore passed in front of us. I do not recommend this branch at all!  (Original) Magasin extr√™mement mal organis√©, nous avons attendu 20 minutes pour passer √† la caisse parce que les employ√©s n‚Äô√©taient point capable de faire leur travail rapidement et faisaient tout sauf passer le plus de clients possibles.

Honestly, she was friendly, helpful and professional. However couple of the pieces that I picked up didn't fit. So I asked her for help again unfortunately, it was 8:45 and she have shelfs to arrange. so she referred me to another employee (Which was the same guy from earlier) ,and I went with him but he was very rude and suddenly he start dropping words like (We have nothing for you) and (try H&M online ""implying that i am annoying his lordship"") and when I told him where I could find another stores he looked at me up and down and annoyingly direct me to couple other stores.  I returned back the stuff I was planing to buy as I am not about paying money for insults and left the store wandering how the hell this guy was allowed to talk to clients. I mean honestly, that guy attitude was so rude I thought I might own him money or maybe he will give me these clothes out of the kindness of his heart. I think H&M must watch some of there employees attitudes."|2

I would recommend this place if you're low on stuff to wear in your house, you can grab a 7 dollar t shirt and a similarly priced short. You'll be able to wear the shirt outside for a while before it loses color in the wash. It's not the best place to shop for larger sizes either currently.

They are trying to make the ""big city"" style store that has multiple floors and it's overall new and clean.  üëé : One big idiocy of this store is that they made 3 floors for clothes but they made a tiny ass changing room area. The line to the changing room is bigger than the pay lines and goes on for so long on busy days (you can spend more time in line than shopping). Not to mention the line blocks people shopping on that floor so people are pushing and shoving to get through. What idiot designed this?! Make it bigger!!

a week ago|Nafiz Islam|It‚Äôs a good trendy clothing store at affordable prices. Most of the Staffs are friendly. It has good selection of women‚Äôs clothing and felt that it has limited options for men. Overall good for affordable prices.|4
a month ago|Greg ‚ÄúGreg‚Äù B|Loves to buy my clothes here because it is not too expensive, I wish we had more big size like on their website. And I hope one day we will have more clothing choices because I visited some H&M which has more clothes for men than here.|4
8 months ago|Toni Pine|Very convenient since we needed umbrellas & a rain coat for my hubby. He also picked up a great shirt.  Prices very reasonable & staff helpful.|4

10 months ago|Nada Awada|Nice winter collection. Have plenty of jogging suits and sweat pants and basics .Medium quality .There are sales on certain items. The above review was in winter. I visited recently in spring and they have sweet colorful ready to wear clothes and they give 15% discount on spot upon registering on line|4
4 months ago|Yedir|Nice store although needs more customer rep!|4
a year ago|Gabrielle Henry|Always a fun store to pick up some trendy pieces. Downside is that at the St. Catherine Street branch the fitting rooms are not available. Very inconvenient when H&M's sizing can be very hard to judge. Yes, you have 30 days to return the item(s) but if you are looking at more than one item in different sizes this can become expensive to get the right size.|4
2 years ago|Justine Soucy|Men's in the basement, Women and Accessories spread across the other 3 floors. They really have a LOT of stuff. So if you like H&M clothing, this is the place to go.  They have changing rooms on all the floors and wait times are pretty reasonable depending on the time you visit.  I don't really shop at this brand as much as before because I find their cheaper stuff too cheap in terms of quality but this is still a really great store for shoes or cheap accessories.|4

4 years ago|Eric Gantwerk|Very good location, easy access. Prices were good. Can't comment on staff except for cashier who was great! He was very personable and efficient. The only reason for the 1 star reduction is there seemed to be too many areas where it was a tight squeeze and hard to move around/past items, but otherwise it was a very good experience.|4

4 years ago|Steven Ball|Good store, lots of variety and definitely better and more stocked than the other H&M in town (the one closer to Place des Arts). You will find lots of cheap and in-trend items at this store. Most styles are only plain though and single coloured, and nothing too crazy or stand out in the styles offered here.|4
10 months ago|Reginald D'Cunha|Great selection.|4
3 years ago|Karine Feddersen|This is a HUGE H&M store! I prefer the layout of the Fairview H&M, but this one is pretty good. It's really hard to find things sometimes because you might have to go on a few floors. The service is always so-so. The associates at the cash are generally very distracted and the change-rooms' associates are generally gossiping. I love team spirit in stores, but I'm not sure that's what it is at this particular H&M.|4
11 months ago|Naive Explorer|I heard a lot about H&M when I was in my country. Because most of their clothing products are manufactured in our country. I am a bit disappointed with the price and quality.|4

3 years ago|Sarah M|It‚Äôs one of the few places on the saint Catherine with wheelchair access, meaning I can actually push a stroller into here and there‚Äôs elevators unlike other shops! The only thing this H&M could have would be a maternity and baby section, then it‚Äôd be perfect. Especially since H&M is one of the few youth focused retailers that offers a nice maternity selection and really cute baby clothe. Please bring them to this location!  Edited October 2019: thanks for adding a huge baby sectionüéâ holla at me when you bring maternity and I‚Äôll basically live here.|4
11 months ago|Yat K|Other than the fact that the staffs looked like they hated their job, the shop itself was good!|4
3 years ago|Isaac Hassan|H & M is a hit or miss store in regards to quality. The quality of the items varies and is inconsistent, some items are decent and some items you can tell just by picking them up is really low quality. You will usually find something in fashion at a low price but you usually pay for what you get.|4
5 years ago|Jonathan Xhelili|It needs a little more for the men...women have 3 floors practically and it's just some of the same stuff dispersed. Men need a little more on the more useful accessories like hats/coats/some shoes. Oh and more room for rooms...if that makes sense.|4
4 years ago|B.A.E - Before Anything Else|My fave place to buy good clothing. The only problem I have is the fitting. Since I'm asian, I have problems with the sizes. But, you have to be very keen on checking the items before taking it. Over-all, it is awesome!|4

4 years ago|K H|"They used to play good music here, but now it is kind of blah. There was a weird cover of MGMT's ""Electric Feel"" that was particularly offputting.  The second floor smelt like someone dropped a bottle of perfume up there.  Reasonably priced nice clothes."|4

3 years ago|Julien Paquier-Galliard|(Translated by Google) A large H&M store can be cluttered, the service is average, there is often a wait at the checkouts. You really have to search to find what you want. There are many many choices (maybe too many) It's definitely not the kind of place where you do your shopping quickly. The quality of the products is not exceptional.  (Original) Un grand magasin H&M un peut fouillis, le service est moyen, il y a souvent de l'attente aux caisses. Il faut vraiment fouill√© pour trouver ce que l'on veut. Il y a beaucoup beaucoup de choix (peut etre trop) C'est d√©finitivement pas le genre d'endroit ou on fait ses courses rapidement. La qualit√© des produits n'est pas exceptionnel.|4
3 years ago|Alex St yves|(Translated by Google) Nice expansive store with quite a bit of selection from what I saw from the men's section. On the other hand, I could see that the sizes seem to become smaller and smaller with the years and the higher prices, if I take for example the jackets/hoodies that I have been buying every year for about 7 years.  (Original) Beau magasin vaste avec pas mal de choix de ce que j'ai vu de la section hommes. Par contre, j'ai pu voir que les grandeurs semblent devenir de plus en plus petites avec les ann√©es et les prix plus √©lev√©s, si je prends par exemple les vestes/hoodies que je rach√®te chaque ann√©e depuis environ 7 ans.|4
